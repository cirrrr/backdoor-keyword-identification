Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F>,told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the maindangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar aswell as crude oil and commodity prices.    Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harmingearnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at thestart of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.    The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, wasbadly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover wasmainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.    Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 andcompetition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings fromlower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by pricecompetition and increased costs.    Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemicalfirms were slightly worse than the year before but the improvedfinancial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,neutralized the negative impact.    Strenger said the industry would try to increase productionin the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out ofWest Germany.    The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall inexports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.    Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far Eastexports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.    Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidencefollowing several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine latelast year. REUTER&#3;"

""We expect to shift our company toward higher value-addedbusinesses and continue to broaden our base,"" Henderson toldreporters at an informal meeting here.    ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S.drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its StuartPharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its currentpharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990.    Henderson said, ""Our pharmaceutical business gets lost inthe way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not.""    ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drugmaker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales wereabout 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs,which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits.    He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical divisionwould account for about 30 pct of total company profits.    ""The drug division far and away brings in the highest rateof return,"" said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, whowas also at the meeting.    Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basicallyact as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugsto doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one.    Henderson said the major new products in the company'spipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrsannually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications,Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin,a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure.    Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvalto market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensingagreements with Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>, is not expected untilabout 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwinin the U.S. later this year.    Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much.    Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by GliddenPaints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from aunit of Hanson Industries Inc.    Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrsavailable for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that moreacquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out anacquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as ""too expensive.""    Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effectiveApril one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones whowill retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing theearnings momentum ICI has established over the past few yearsafter restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

""All of ourbusinesses are producing better results than last year, eventhough we do not see significant improvement in the externalmarket environment,"" he said.    Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders inaddition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.    Domestic industrial automation and control orders weremodestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.    Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation andcontrol business were flat in the U.S. and up in internationalmarkets, it said.    International orders increased, with the greatest strengthin Europe, Honeywell said.    The company said that by year-end 1987, it intends tocomplete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a fivemln share buyback program which began in 1986. Reuter&#3;"

Sony will have an irregular five-month business term endingMarch 31, as its financial year will be changed to run fromApril 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.    Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.

The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recentappreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in marketprices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.    The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.

Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from onemln due to lower exports to China.    Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrssales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the threemonths compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.

But margins improved in the second half and in particularrefining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a goodrecovery.    The company was commenting on results that showed a netloss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in1985.    The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stgprovision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialledby Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquidnatural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownershipof Gulf Canada's marketing assets.    Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of afurther reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by awithdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling itsU.S. Flag shipping operation.    The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertainalthough it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increasein the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimisticprices would strengthen over the longer term.    Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas putit in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.    In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improveprofitability by selling or restructuring weak operations whilestrengthening core businesses and developing a soundoperational and financial base.

Last week Heinz reported third-quarter earnings rose to 55cts a share from 46 cts a share. Sales rose to 1.08 billiondlrs from 1.01 billion dlrs a year earlier.    O'Reilly said Heinz will concentrate on backing its bigbrands, new products and services, new geography, internalgrowth and acquisitions.    He said Heinz Ketchup has its highest market share inhistory, 55 pct. But in response to a question, the executivesaid a volume falloff in the overall product category ""is aconcern to us.""    O'Reilly said Weight Watchers continues to perform well andwill generate revenue in fiscal 1987 of approximately 940 mlndlrs.    O'Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations tobuild a second plant in China, where it entered a joint venturewith the government in 1984, forming Heinz-UFE Ltd, whichproduces dry baby food cereal.    He said Heinz-Japan is ""making a profit and generating itsfirst substantial dividends,"" and implementation of a newpartnership, Seoul-Heinz Ltd, is moving ahead with a newmanufacturing plant targeted for completion by June in Seoul,South Korea.    To increase its competitiveness, O'Reilly said Heinzimplemented a ""lowest cost imaginable"" program targeted atmanufacturing, sales and marketing and procurement.    He said a modernization program is in effect at thecompany's United Kingdom operations, where the labor force,trimmed to 4,000 from 10,000, is expected to be further reducedto 2,500 in 1988.

0,"One of General Electric Co's biggestbusinesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasingprofits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,Wall Street analysts said.    Previously, it was expected the business would peak anddecline at some point in the next five years. The improvedoutlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 newplanes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.    ""Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,"" saidNicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangementsfor its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>twinjet long distance aircraft.    But AMR said it was using ""rent-a-plane leases"" that allowit to operate the aircraft without adding to its debtstructure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of theplanes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protectsAMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severedownturn in the economy.    From GE's point of view the package looks like a good dealfor several reasons, Heymann said.    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time ofdelivery, Heymann noted.    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planesGE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,would have little trouble rounding up another airline thatwanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the dealappears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.    GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares bymidafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Uphamand Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company ""no oneorder will have much of an effect on the stock.""    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said theorder ""will help to maintain a good level of production andprofitability in the aircraft engine business"" for GE.    Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet enginebusiness rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrsby 1991.    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs lastyear, with well over half of the business in the militarysector, according to analysts' estimates.    The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincideswith an upbeat performance in other segments.    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the firstquarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corpthat it has a ""unique ability"" to buy a major business andreshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with otherelements of its 14 business areas.    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the currentquarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by theNBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.    Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in partcrediting ""significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."" Reuter&#3;"

General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profitforecast, saying targets were under study.    Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group'soutstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs,up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowingsrose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters.    Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parentcompany rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries &lt;XiamenInternational Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and &lt;LusoInternational Bank Ltd> in Macao.    The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985but did not officially open until March 1986.    Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreignpartner, Hong Kong-listed &lt;Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cutlast year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreignbanks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the threeChinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.    Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin wereunfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported aloss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of268,000 dlrs in 1985.    The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank ofChina, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) andXiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).    One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced thesame problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete onunequal terms with state-owned banks.

At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easilytopped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from aneven dollar to 1.20 dlrs.    Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM'sperformance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a fullrecovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not befelt until later in the year.    These include the success of IBM's new personal computerline, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,which will begin volume shipments in July.    In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of itsearly-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves willemerge as the year progresses.    Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F.

0,"Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale&lt;WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLBInternational SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.    WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend toWestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.    The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the recordprofit of the previous year could not be repeated, due tochanged market conditions, it said. Increased funds were alsoallocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of1987 developed positively, it added.    WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks forinternational credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in thebalance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.    Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mlnin 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact thatcredit business redemptions were not fully offset by newlending.    The statement said WestLB International's business withprivate customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.    This development was aided by cooperation between the bankand the savings banks in the West German state of NorthRhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.    Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of1.1 billion.    WestLB International said it plans to expand its range ofservices for private clients. REUTER&#3;"

Krupp GmbH&lt;KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.    Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.    Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar'sweakness against the mark and oil and raw materials pricefalls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery andplant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.    Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineeringbusiness achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions hadunderpinned machinery and component activities.    An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, thetrading and services sectors, affected the group's total orderfigures.    However, ""all business sectors contributed to the positiveresults achieved in 1986,"" Krupp added, without giving details.    Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marksfrom the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct oforders against 40 pct in 1985.    Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11member companies which comprise the core area of the group,rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.    The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks atend-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.

0,"Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG[OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record amoderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mlnschilling net profit made in 1986, General Director GerhardWagner said.    Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pctrise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due togreater domestic business and wider margins on schillinginterest rates.    The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividendto 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capitalfrom 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.    Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: ""We will endeavourto maintain the higher dividend in 1987.""    Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreigncurrency business last year accounted for some 37 pct ofbalance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.    Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign businesschiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which iseffectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wipedsome 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.    Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits fromthe bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but saidthat it came close to one mln stg.    On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pctto 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.    According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due tolower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state. Reuter&#3;"
0,"Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> earningsfor 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult marketconditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due todifferent accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said.    The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year,while the additional effect of currency movements reduced thecontribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg.    The group earlier reported a drop in net income for theyear to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, withlower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales byvolume.    Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless atthe top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and TradingPlc &lt;SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stgfrom a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that ageneral collapse in exploration and production volumes waspartially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mlnstg from 205 mln in 1985.    Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expectedcurrency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarterresults, which was the main reason for the figures exceedingforecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de ZoeteWedd noted.    However, he added there could well be a sharp fall inperformance in the first quarter of 1987, due to theimprobability that the group would be able to repeat the highrefining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.    The impact of recovering oil prices would come throughfaster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such ahigh proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, whichtypically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-yearlag, analysts said.    Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the thirdquarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.    Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit inthe period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease inU.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the grouphad increased share to become volume market leader, Holmesadded.    Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdueU.S. Exploration activity. ""Exploration is currently prettyflat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be nomassive upturn,"" he said.    A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the NorthSea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.    Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. ""Ifyou are not exploring you are not going to find anything,"" henoted.    U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayedbelow 20 dlrs a barrel.    This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices, as thelower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPECmarginal production shutting down. ""OPEC has done prettyextraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,""he added. Reuter&#3;"

0,"Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG&lt;BKFG.F>, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mlnmarks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholderAachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG &lt;AMVG.F>, AMB, said.    But total operating and extraordinary profits, includingearnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's ownaccount and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said.    BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB'scapital increase, which is to finance the insurance company'sacquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.    Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid anunchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred anunchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,&lt;Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from whichAMB has acquired the majority stake.    The bank has said its business last year suffered from theturbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housingconcern Neue Heimat.    AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.    The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in theinterest margin to 1.9 pct.    A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.    The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step uprisk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasisedbecause of the continuing difficulties of some countries.    Disclosed risk provisions, which under West Germanaccounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.    BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pctof this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.    BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01pct of &lt;Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9pct of &lt;BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> andfive pct of &lt;Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linkedto AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG.    These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transferagreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions. REUTER&#3;"

Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits fromoperations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrscompared with 1.23 billion in 1985.    They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain ofabout 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its CathayPacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG> unit last May.    Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.    Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividendfor its ""A"" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 centsadjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.    Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of thecompany's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits,analysts said.    The company's aviation division consists of its majoritystake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in&lt;Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pctowned by Cathay.    Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuelcosts and greater traffic.    Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before theflotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and hassince slipped to 50.23 pct.    Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profitsrose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.    Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd,estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.    ""Much depends on properties,"" said Measor. ""And they did a lotbetter in the second half of the year.""    Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned SwireProperties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mlncompared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.    Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrsfor the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for thesame 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to thelow level of completion of new residential flats. The firm'sproperties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residentialdevelopment and two luxury housing projects.    Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats inTaikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs insecond-half 1986.    During the year property prices continued to rise as morepeople bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates,analysts said.    ""At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were sellingat 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a yearago,"" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.)Ltd.    Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex inthe central business district of Hong Kong but it will notprovide income until the first stage is completed next year.    The company also sold three properties and a part interestin a proposed hotel development, which should result inextraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to JamesCapel (Far East) Ltd.    Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expectedto earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping andoffshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

0,"First City Bancorporation's sale of 54mln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential-Bache should significantlyreduce its energy problems, but the bank's losses are stillvirtually guaranteed to continue, analysts said.    The package of energy loans was sold at book value, soFirst City did not to show a gain or loss, said bank spokesmanJames Day. He added it was possible First City would sell moreof the bank's remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oil-related loansto raise cash.    The loans had been made by First City to oil producers andto oilfield service and supply companies. Day said some hadalready been classified as nonperforming, or charged off as aloss, but he could not identify how many were included in thosecategories.    The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache's EnergyGrowth Fund, a limited partnership created last month with 90mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties.    First City, the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturnin oil prices, lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some othercapital assistance. The Houston-based bank's nonperformingassets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yearend, up from 563.1 mlndlrs at the end of 1985    Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested inthe troubled bank unless government assistance is available.    ""Their problems are not just limited to energy. They have asubstantial portfolio in real estate. This sale in and ofitself won't make the company look better to a potentialbuyer,"" said Ray Archibold, a banking analyst with McCarthy,Crisanti and Maffei Inc.    ""It does reduce the bank's exposure in energy loans and 54mln dlrs is a substantial amount,"" Archibold said, ""but thedeal represents only about four pct of their energy loans.""    Of First City's total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs, about14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers orsuppliers, analysts said. Its record losses have been caused byits past status as one of the nation's top lenders to oil andgas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late1970s and early 1980s.    First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudentialcame from its Energy Finance Co., an entity formed in 1982 toloan money to ""more venturesome"" oil borrowers that promised ahigher potential return. The other half of the loans were fromFirst City's lead bank in Houston.    Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co., saidthe sale of the package of energy loans was the firstencouraging news from First City in months.    ""It's not going to solve all of First City's problems butit's a good transaction for them. It may be possible for themto sell additional loans,"" Kotowski said. ""Prudential can fundthese things more cheaply than First City and there's anincentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now asvalues are depressed""    In a statement, First City chairman J.A. Elkins said thebank's strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans tototal loans. ""This move, which we believe is the firsttransaction of its kind, helps us further, and we were able tomake it without suffering a loss."" Reuter&#3;"
0,"Media group John Fairfax Ltd &lt;FFXA.S>said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected theimpact of changes in the Australian tax system.    Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mlna year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30mln from 44.29 mln.    Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase incompany tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax onfringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, thecompany said in a statement.    Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenuegrowth in the television industry as another reason for theflat first half earnings.    It said it considered the result satisfactory in view ofthese factors.    Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney MorningHerald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, asdid the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremelysatisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.    But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0pct rise in revenue, it said.    Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to netearnings because group borrowings were reduced following thereceipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from &lt;AustralianAssociated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's ""B""shares in Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L>.    This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.    Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for thefull year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlracquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbournewill hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens inSydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.

0,"The state oil company Petroeleos deVenezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income fromoil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal byalmost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and MinesArturo Hernandez Grisanti said.    Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annualassembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales haddropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from lastyear's 13.3 billion.    Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34pct which Hernandez said ""had a very serious impact onVenezuela.""    PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, ofwhich 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refinedproducts.    The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpdand the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was notenough to cover the losses from a drop in the average pricefrom 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.    The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higherthan the figure originally announced by the Central Bank.Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accountingsystem which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refiningand marketing operations.    Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However,Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keepgasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.    Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrelsin reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance ofVenezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country'sproduction capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, ofwhich 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.

0,"&lt;Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit onexploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil priceslast year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.    But he told a press conference that due to the highmarginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact ofthe drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.    The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, withPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, hesaid.    As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration andproduction sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.    Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/ShellGroup &lt;RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against8.81 mln.    Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oiloutput from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for thecompany. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in thecurrent year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the declinein output from the major Brent field, he said.    Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gasliquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected tobe maintained in 1987, he said.    A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and OspreyNorth Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oilprice fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.    Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider NorthSea fields, which were approved last year, have brought thecost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.    Day to day operating costs of the exploration andproduction sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the targetis to keep costs per barrel constant.    The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading tothe discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early togauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.    Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to aprofit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.    Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit &lt;ShellU.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987were a ""bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.""    In November and December in particular, refining operationshad shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oilproduct prices, he said. He expected margins to continuegenerally positive over the summer, although they could dip tobecome negative from time to time, depending on pricemovements.    A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery willnow come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about fivemonths behind schedule, following a crane accident whichseverely damaged the plant last year, he said.    Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemicalsite.    Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by whichcompanies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifyingdevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields againstPRT, was ""helpful,"" but rather less than had been hoped for.    Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was inthe range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, hewould expect some over-production above OPEC""s official 15.8 mlnbpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.    He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrainoutput was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil willfall. Reuter&#3;"

0,"West German banks would like Brazil to workmore closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with aview to seeking a solution to the country's debt problems,senior West German banking sources said.    The sources, speaking ahead of a meeting later todaybetween Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his Westgerman counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg, also believed Brazilshould come up with a convincing economic recovery program.    Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson, who met Funaro yesterday.    Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involvegovernments in negotiations with commercial banks onrescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt, which totals some109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solveits problems with the banks rather than governments.    Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave earlytomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg thisevening.    Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with theIMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to anausterity program with the Fund.    However, the West German banking sources said institutionshere felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented acredible recovery program and that there be a ""rapprochement""with the IMF.    ""Consultations are the least that can be expected,"" said onebanker.    Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago tosuspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercialdebt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited byforeign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs.    One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debtnegotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funarofor a change in the structure of the advisory committee ofbanks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982.    Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks, holding 35 pct ofBrazilian debt, were over-represented on the 14-bank advisorycommittee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazilmight adopt a different approach to its creditor banks,involving separate discussions with the regions.    Such a move would be in Brazil's interest, since Europeanbanks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternativedebt solutions, such as interest capitalisation.    The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regionalapproach, saying: ""There must be one committee and one solution.""But he added: ""There must be an understanding that specialrequests from special regions be taken into account.""    German banks had objected to the fact that the idea ofinterest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. Itwas imperative that alternative options be considered. ""The menumust become richer,"" the banker said.    Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involvedin today's talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank inFrankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented.    West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to theBrazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions inthe United States, because of their lower exposure.    According to Bundesbank data from September last year, WestGerman bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreigncredit. REUTER&#3;"

The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 netearnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, againstanalysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln.    CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend untillater this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputationto its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-freeto shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which thefull 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id.    The company operates on a substituted tax year, not thefiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax atthe 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.    Consequently, it has funds available for distribution withdividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputationlegislation before determining the final payout, it said.    Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a pooryear for the minerals industry, with the notable exception ofgold producers.    Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollarsdeclined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.    Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatilityand uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading tosubstantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.    World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories havesteadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,but overcapacity continues, CRA said.    Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA saidBougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrswhile its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.    Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrsagainst 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.    Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operationsincurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in1985, CRA said.    Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrsagainst 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mlnfrom 2.8 mln.    CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond projectamounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.    CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinaryloss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchangelosses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.    Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided forclosures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase infuture tax provisions, CRA said.    Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrsbefore capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. Thestrong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rightsissue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debtto be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.    CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost. REUTER&#3;"

The banks following the trend are the &lt;Overseas Union BankLtd>, &lt;United Overseas Bank Ltd>, &lt;Oversea-Chinese BankingCorporation> and the &lt;Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>.    The shift towards securitisation has been helped byvolatile financial markets which have developed hedgingfacilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for riskmanagement, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.    Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks seelimited growth in credit risk. More and more of them areswitching from term lending to major growth areas such asstockbroking and fee based income, he said.    Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after beinggranted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are nowmoving into the new government securities market and the StockExchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.    One foreign banker said the Development Bank and theOverseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equitymarket in Singapore.    Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market hasincreased business transactions and provided long term growthfor the market. The banks are not competition for individualstockbroking firms because of the increased business theygenerate, he added.    Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expandequity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year becauseof the increasing ability of foreign and local marketparticipants to absorb new issues.    Loh said &lt;OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary ofthe Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm tolaunch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investorsseeking capital growth through a diversified internationalportfolio. It will invest in international shares with theemphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.    &lt;DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of theDevelopment Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong KongStock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.    Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates inSingapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will beforced to provide fund management services for major clientsseeking better returns, he said.    Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the majorbanks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income fromtreasury and investment banking activities.    They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chineseand United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pctagainst respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.    Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.

It said the commission is currently allowing the company torecover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.    As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each monthas deferred non-cash account receivable, which has beenincluded in current income.    But the accounting change, effective January 1, willreflect only cash received through interim rates approved bythe commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.

Eder is charged with conspiring with unnamed supervisors atPaineWebber to prevent the filing of Currency TransactionReports with the Internal Revenue Service. Federal law requiresthat reports be filed with the IRS for any single cashtransaction in one day of more than 10,000 dlrs.    Asked about the charges, a Painewebber spokeswoman said thecompany had not seen the indictment and had no comment. Shesaid Eder was suspended January 22 and resigned from the firmon february 17.    David Spears, the federal prosecutor in charge of the case,said Eder received cash from individual customers in amountsranging up to 70,000 dlrs at a time but avoided filing reportsby depositing the cash into the customers' accounts in amountsjust under 10,000 dlrs on several different days.    If convicted, Eder could receive a maximum jail term of tenyears and 260,000 dlrs in fines.    Reuter&#3;"

0,"With the April 15 tax return deadlineless than a month away, confused taxpayers will be convergingon H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes.    Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer areexpected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a""bonanza,"" analysts say.    ""For the short term the key word is confusion, Block VicePresident Tom Bloch said in an interview. ""When Congressdrastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparersbenefit,"" Bloch said.    ""Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and placethem side by side to compare them, more people will throw theirhands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'"" he said.""Tax forms will look very different next year,"" he added.    Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block'sfiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains overfiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share onrevenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block's fiscal 1987earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs.    ""Next year, Block could have a bonanza,"" Buchbinder said.Based on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show again of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. Inthe 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns,up 1.5 pct over the previous year.    The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mlnindividual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 taxseason, up from last year's 94 mln forms. Professional taxpreparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, accordingto the IRS.    For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bringclients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide,there are some changes in the act that will have a negativeeffect, Bloch conceded.    Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the taxreturn, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. Inaddition, some low income wage earners will be taken off thetax rolls, he said.    Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try tooffset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average costfor each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73dlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be upabout three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, hesaid.    Block expects ""some expansion"" this tax season of itselectronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS andcan speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and byhow much it wants to expand into the seven cities madeavailable for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted.    The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directlyfiled this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected inthe 1986 tax season.    First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Blockwill benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988.    Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about thesame as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs fortelevision ads. ""They may get a little more bang for theirbuck,"" he said.    He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on itsbalance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it couldbe of great benefit to them. Reuter&#3;"

Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipelinefrom service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams hada net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billiondlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46billion in 1985.    In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest PipelineCorp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that areamong the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gasreserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feetin 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.    The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which hasless take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, shouldshow improvement in its 1987 operating results because ofchanges tariff and federal tax rates.    The company's gas marketing business is expected to havesomewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in itsoperating region, the annual report said. The gas marketingunit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.    Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in itsdebt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mlndlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co andproceeds from the sale and leaseback of WilliamsTelecommunications Co.

The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements receiveda qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co.The auditors said their opinion was subject to First Cityeventually obtaining additional capital.    ""The company believes that in order to address itslong-term needs and return to a satisfactory level ofoperations, it will ultimately need several hundred milliondollars of additional capital, or a combination with a morestrongly capitalized entity,"" First City said in a note to itsfinancial statements included in the annual report.    ""Management believes that sufficient resources should beavailable to cover interim capital concerns while additionalcapital is being sought,"" the bank said.    To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sellor mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributionsto its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some ofits member banks.    ""The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially lessthan in 1986,"" First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letterincluded in the annual report. ""However, the ultimate return tosatisfactory operating conditions is dependent on thesuccessful resolution of the related problems of creditquality, funding and the eventual need for substantialadditional capital.""    First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of acredit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most ofFirst City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments wouldbe modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoiddefault.    The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenantslast year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks.    Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratiosexceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986,First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. FirstCity National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio.    Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estateprices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrslast year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more thandoubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of1986.    First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its totalenergy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billiondlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs ""shouldbe more modest."" The amount represented 15 pct of First City'stotal loans.    In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assetsnearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end.Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or ninepct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amountcould go higher.    ""The company still faces uncertainties in the real estatemarket and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolioso long as the regional recession persists,"" First City said.""Because the carrying value of many of these loans iscollateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value ofthe collateral base could cause an increase in the level ofreal estate-related chargeoffs.""

0,"The United States' dependency onforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Associates.    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conferencehere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as muchas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous highlevel of 47 pct in 1977.    ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oilimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990.    ""However, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction,"" Lichtblau said.    He said that one of the government's negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration.    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.    ""An international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than ifwe imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said.    Development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessenU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.    A potential for alternative supplies could limit thewillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offertax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the StrategicPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plansfor alternative energy.

1,"Britain and West Germany told theirEuropean Community partners they would strongly oppose majorelements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.    At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for afull debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that hasalready angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-ledprotests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said.    West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, willadvise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenanceother proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.    They said West Germany's objections were put in a letterthis weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, thepresident of the EC's Executive Commission which had putforward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new ECcash crisis.    Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cerealsproduction curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for aproposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) -a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level outforeign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.    Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit Germanfarmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult toexport to weaker currency states, which means virtually allother 11 EC states, diplomats said.    Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to imposea hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because itcould seriously damage EC trade relations.    The diplomats said the United States had been the mostoutspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing itas a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade bodyGATT.    But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC,such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina,Iceland and Norway, they added.    Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farmreform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures thatcould spark a damaging trade war with the U.S.    Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision oneither the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today,diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear thatneither has a chance of surviving when it comes up forsubstantive consideration by EC farm ministers later thismonth, they added. REUTER&#3;"

In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputertrade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not makesupercomputers.    Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticatedmicrochips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chipsand supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said.    Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposedtakeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying ""the purchasewould not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductormarket.""    Two separate issues appear to have come together to boostpressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.    The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open itsdomestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said.    U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanesepublic sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despiteU.S. Firms' technological lead in the field.    ""The United States believes Japan will only react whenbullied, and this is a bullying ploy,"" Salomon Brothers Asiaanalyst Carole Ryavec said.    However, the analysts said more is at stake thansupercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vitalsemiconductor industry to Japanese competitors.    ""The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,""said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co.    U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade hasfailed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firmsto abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricingand opening Japan's market.    A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abidingby the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale ofmicrochips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below thoseset by the pact.    ""It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,""he told Reuters.    Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on theacquisition in line with the basic agreement reached withSchlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters. REUTER&#3;"

1,"Today's sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks andmatching falls around Europe may have been overdone, but themood on financial markets is precarious, Swiss securitiesanalysts and economists said.    Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the openingon enormous volume, triggered by the slide on Wall Street andthe threat of renewed currency instability.    ""I have never experienced anything like this, and I've beenin the business for 20 years,"" said Bernhard Wyttenbach, head ofEuropean research at Union Bank of Switzerland.    The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on U.S. Monetaryauthorities. This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerpublicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetarypolicy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilisecurrencies was still working, but added: ""On the other hand, wewill not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interestrates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the UnitedStates will raise rates.""    Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) inZurich said: ""The situation is very dangerous. Statements by theU.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates.""    Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank'sfinancial research department, called the sell-off ""overdone,""but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banksloosen their monetary policy.    ""I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over,"" hesaid. ""The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step inwith an easy money policy, or else there is going to be aneconomic catastrophe. They have to act quickly.""    Wyttenbach said the ""Black Monday"" sell-off was clearlyexaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participationcertificates falling 20 pct in value at one point.    But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correctionwould come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investorsonly in time for tomorrow's market, when there could beanother, smaller selling wave.    ""As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --then we'll get a strong movement upward,"" Wyttenbach said. Butthat may not come soon.    ""People are simply worried that in America, where the markethas now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,""he said. ""People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988.""    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the currentproblems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. ""We do not have amark problem, we have a dollar problem,"" he added, but said thebiggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. FederalReserve Board, Alan Greenspan.    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that thedollar might be too high in the medium term and that interestrates might have to rise. ""As a central banker he shouldn't dothat,"" Wyttenbach said. ""There is a danger that we will fall backinto the 1970s,"" he said. ""We have a real crisis of confidence inGreenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker.""    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: ""I'm relatively optimisticbecause the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has tointervene.""    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to takeany significant steps, adding that the focus of attentionremains on the United States.    ""The panic started in New York, it has to end there.""    The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggestingthey not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while beforedeciding what to do.

1,"Britain has decided to resist U.S.pressure and retain powers to withdraw tax credits from U.S.parent companies based in states which impose unitary taxes onthe worldwide profits of foreign-owned firms, TreasuryFinancial Secretary Norman Lamont told Parliament.    But he added that the eventual use of those powers wouldnot be backdated if activated before the end of 1988.    The U.K. Government has consistently opposed the use ofunitary taxation of international business on grounds they arecontrary to internationally accepted principles, laid down bythe United Nations and the OECD, Treasury sources said.    In a written parliamentary answer, Lamont said ""in themeantime, progress towards a final resolution of the unitarytax issues will be kept under careful review"" by Britain.    ""Should it be necessary to take action ... Before December31, 1988, it will not apply to dividends paid before the dateof the announcement of such action. If it is necessary to takeaction thereafter, it will not apply to dividends on or beforeDecember 31, 1988,"" Lamont said.    The Reagan Administratian published draft legislation latein 1985 to limit states use of unitary taxation to the profitsmade inside the U.S., Known as the ""water's edge"" method.    In response to that draft legislation, Britain agreed todefer initiating action under its Finance Act 1985 - but onlyon the understanding that legislation to resolve the unitarytax issue would be made law and take effect from end-December1986.    Then the U.S. Administration said in September 1986 that ithad decided not to pursue Federal legislation, in view of thepassing of legislation in California.    Britain, however, considers the California legislationunsatisfactory, not least because U.K. Business will have topay a fee for the right of not being assessed by the unitarytax method, government sources said.

1,"&lt;San Miguel Corp>, SMC, and &lt;UnitedCoconut Planters Bank>, UCPB, have reached a compromise on adisputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of agovernment panel that controls the sequestered shares said.    Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on GoodGovernment (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB.    ""It looks good,"" Diaz said. But he added several issues,including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares,had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to thesale.    The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares abortedSMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in theUCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares wereactually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate offormer President Ferdinand Marcos.    Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB whenhe fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration.    ""The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB areowned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,"" Diaz said. ""Naturally we donot want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies.""    PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a downpayment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiaryNeptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.    The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would beforfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed tofulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originallynegotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.    PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food andbeverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln ""B"" class sharesfrom the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at aprice of 150 pesos per share.    The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion pesotransaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferredshares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollecteddividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced toUCPB-controlled trading companies.    The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per sharemade by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15pct stock dividend declared in June last year.    A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board mettoday to discuss the proposed compromise.    The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the boardmeeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.    President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB toset up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownershipissue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.    Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMCboard, filed a formal complaint before the Securities andExchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight otherdirectors of violating ""fiduciary duty.""

1,"A 3.22 billion dlr offer for DomePetroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the doorfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said.    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire.    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations.    TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto.    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.    ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary.    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said.    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added.    ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward,"" he said.    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said.    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's.    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.    However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer. Reuter&#3;"

1,"GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-WarnerCorp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts tobe preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.     Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill LynchCapital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash andsecurities for the balance.    Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.    ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming inwith another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at51 or 52 dlrs per share.    GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct ofBorg-Warner's stock.    ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to upthe price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you haveto. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're lookingat it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst RichardHenderson said.    Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.    GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. MerrillLynch officials did not return phone calls.    Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heymansought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plasticsbusiness. The rigid plastics are used in such things astelephones, computer terminals, and appliances.    ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemicaloperation these days,"" said Henderson.    ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and hedoes not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson.    GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeoverof the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAFdid not win the company, it made a substantial gain on itsinvestment in Carbide.    Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into itsBorg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offerand does not succeed, a higher bid from another company wouldgive GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.    ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst.    One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would beforthcoming shortly.    ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in thisbook,"" he said.    Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,protective services, which includes Wells Fargo securityguards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.    Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who followsGAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, itwould realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 pershare.    ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" saidRose.    Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heymanwould do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.""    ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemicalenterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rosesaid.    Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would addearnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, ifthey sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said JohnHenry of E.F. Hutton.    Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billiondlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and netearnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.

1,"The British government may revoke thelicences of selected Japanese banks and securities companiesoperating in London's financial City when they come up forrenewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening upJapan's markets to foreign competition, government sourcessaid.    ""We can't say ""yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)""but this is definitely being considered,"" an official said.    His comments came after the government was formally urgedtoday by a cross-section of influential MPs to take jointretaliatory action with the United States against Japan.    Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanesetrade practices. ""There's a sense of urgency here now, but theemphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests inJapan,"" another government official told Reuters.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday thatBritain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in theFinancial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliateagainst countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.    She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.    The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7billion stg, official figures show.    A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged theU.K. Government to ""coordinate action with the President of theUnited States, and through the Department of Trade andIndustry, to suspend all further applications from Japanesecommunications companies for equipment approval by the BritishApprovals Board for Telecommunications, and all furtherapplications from Japanese financial institutions for licences""until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called""restrictive conditions"" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC)(cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake inJapan's international telecommunications market.    The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-sectionof MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament.Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure onthe Conservative government to take firm action.    Officials said another option now being considered by theU.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japaneseinstitutions. That could be done under the government'sproposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.    58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to dealin London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-basedfirms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.    The new financial services and banking acts offer Britainan alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise deniedunder legally-binding international trade agreements.    ""The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and IndustrySecretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging ininvestment, banking and insurance,"" one official said.    ""This point has been made to the Japanese at official levela number times,"" the official added.    Britain and France are now working together to urge thatthe European Community take collective action against Japan,but by working within EC treaties, another official said.    British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radiointerview that the European Community should build barriersagainst Japanese imports through certification proceduressimilar to those facing European exporters in Japan.    ""There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,"" hesaid, adding ""(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight.""Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade""strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have afair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which isitself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of ourown domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.""    The situation is only likely to worsen following news thatJapan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by morethan 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrsfrom 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.    But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visibletrade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.    Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financialinstitutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, ratherthan larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a globalbusiness centre, government sources said. Japan's four largestsecurities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.    In Washington, White House officials said President Reaganwas ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan forbreaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.    There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act onthe recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curbJapanese exports to the United States but officials said themove could come today or early next week.    Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reaganincluded tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports whichuse semiconductors. REUTER&#3;"

1,"A top Swiss banker called for anobligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds andsaid he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a companyshould be made to declare their share.    In comments at a news conference of &lt;Vontobel Holding AG>,chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks'own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board,to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in.    A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swissfranc market and a debate on the use of registered shares toprevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.    Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to themarket with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which werereadily available to professionals through specialisedinformation systems.    ""We should make this classification obligatory and publishit in places that are easily accessible to lay people,"" he said.The quick changing nature of the financial market meant theseratings should also be continually updated, he said.    Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies,worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered sharesand participation certificates rather than bearer shares.    However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. Therecent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> to take over HeroConserven Lenzburg &lt;HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someonewho was not eligible according to the company's statutes.

""Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and weneed to get a clarification out,"" the spokesman said, addingthat there was a ""50-50"" chance a statement would be releasedtoday.    The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.    Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for severalweeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developerDonald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he alsoheld discussions with its chairman.    The developer indicated in those talks that he took theposition as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buyingUAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2mln shares.    ""United has got to consider this proposal. I think thepilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,but it could put some interesting options in front of UALmanagement,"" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attackwhen it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertzrental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in astrategy to become a travel service company.    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots unionconcerned that the company was not focussing enough attentionon its airline.    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing itsnew focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street hasbeen busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL aswidespread, indicative to them that big institutions believethe stock is in play.    Market sources have said that although Trump attractedattention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as acatalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhapsthrowing the company into the hands of another buyer.    ""The first domino is you have an investor with aconsiderable stake. the second domino is the union. That typeof attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,""said Pettee.

Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubtedanother bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for salefor sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.    Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. Ithad been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer onFriday.

1,"A Japanese businessman announced plans fora new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable andWireless Plc would be a core company.    However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation ofEconomic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does notspecify what stake Cable and Wireless would have.    ""The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,""Watanabe said in a statement. ""The actual percentage ofshareholdings should be agreed by the core companies.""    He said the eight core companies will provide directors forthe firm.    ""The new company shall immediately set to work on thefeasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,""Watanabe said.    Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups,one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against&lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan'soverseas telephone business.    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wantsonly one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts.    A British source, who declined to be identified further,said the proposals could open the door to further talks betweenC and W &lt;CAWL.L> and the other firms involved.    C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal whichwould have given it a five pct share in the newtelecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pctstake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stakein one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge.    The British source said the decision not to specify theexact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the dooropen for further discussion.    ""It's probably a sensible approach on their part,"" theBritish source told reuters.    C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay anew cable between Japan and the U.S.    The proposed merger has sparked an international row, withBritish government sources threatening retaliatory actionagainst Japan for what they see as discriminatory practicesagainst foreign firms.    The sources said last Friday that one option for Britainwould be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securitiescompanies operating in London.    The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans,saying that both rival consortia should be licensed.    Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms,Watanabe said, ""They will not be core companies but if they wishthey could participate."" Under the Japanese law, total foreignparticipation would be limited to one-third.    ""It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which hasthe support of many influential backers and work within thisfor the realization of their ideas,"" Watanabe told reporters.    The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>, Mitsuiand Co &lt;MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp &lt;SUMT.T>, Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co &lt;MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co&lt;CITT.T>, and &lt;Pacific Telesis International Inc>.

1,"The federal Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC) is looking for possible securities lawsviolations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid byHollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp,attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.    During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's GiantGroup Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.    It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a LosAngeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on aportion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.    In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mlndlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham LambertInc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of theproceeds to buy TRE stock.    Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly sixpct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.    The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SECwas investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TREholdings were working together without disclosing theircooperation, as would be required by the federal securitieslaws.    One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whetherSugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of itsintended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mlndlr bond offering.    A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unitof Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SECinvestigators and was cooperating with the probe.

1,"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra DayO'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunctionblocking the planned merger of Delta &lt;DAL> AirlinesInc and Western Airlines &lt;WAL>, the Court said.    O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel ofthe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco hadblocked the merger until a dispute over union representationhad been settled by arbitration.    A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay ofthe injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,to go through as planned later today.    The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Eachof the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over aparticular regional Appellate circuit and has the power toprovisionally overturn its rulings without comment.    The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials ofAtlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the mergerfor months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanesbelonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.    ""Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,""Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution latelast night. ""There was really very little that remained to bedone.""    The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had beenfiled in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air TransportEmployees union sought to force Western's management to fulfilla promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger tookplace.    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not beenforced in a takeover by a larger company.

Delta announced last September that it was purchasingWestern. The merger took place in December, and Western hasbeen operated as a Delta subsidiary since then.

1,"Computer Associates International Inc's800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE> will eliminate itsstrongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competitionfrom International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, Wall Streetanalysts said.     ""IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systemssoftware,"" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkinand Jenrette.    ""But the combination of the two companies will clearlypresent a much stronger front,"" he said.    Besides IBM, ""Computer Associates will be far and away themost powerful company in the field,"" added E.F. Hutton analystTerence Quinn.    That field is a segment of the market known as systemutilities, or software packages that boost the productivity ofa company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.    The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines thetwo biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms thatwill find the competition much harder than in the past.    For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps asix-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.    When the deal is completed sometime in August, thecompany's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independentsoftware vendor.    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wangtook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computerbusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframecomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after themerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of sixcompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, onsales of 141.5 mln dlrs.    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largelybecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from thedark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or56 cts a share.   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 differentbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computersoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and amajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from hisjob as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer servicesunit.    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at anews conference that the merger would give computer users asingle source for a wide range of software products.    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates alsosell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroadsin the applications software market, where analysts said it hasbeen successful with accounting and banking systems.    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support andenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that thecompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He saidabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings ofcurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. Butthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not diluteComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.    Quinn of E.F.

Wang said he would look closely at the combined operationsof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketingand research and development.    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said mostsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 timesper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth thepremium because of its earnings potential and customer base.    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currentlyowns 58 pct of Uccel.    The executive said the merger would not alter his target ofmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having thedeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. JusticeDepartment.

""It would inject the federal government so deeply back into the process, we would never get the government out again,and I think that would be in the long term disinterest of thenation,"" Hodel said in an address to a group of local businessexecutives.    Earlier today, Congressmen from oil producing statesintroduced a bill that would impose a fee on oil imports.    Hodel said he supports drilling incentives, such as repealof the Windfall Profits Tax and Fuel Use Act and deregulationof natural gas.    The secretary also said oil and gas exploration offshoreCalifornia and in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge isnecessary to prevent the U.S. from becoming too dependent onforeign supplies of oil for its energy needs.    Failure to approve such exploration, Hodel said, would leadto greater U.S. dependence on foreign sources of oil.    ""In the next two to five years, no matter what we do today,we are very likely to find the U.S becoming 50 pct or moredependent on imports for its oil requirements,"" Hodel said.

2,"Canada's federal governmentwill provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package thatincludes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of acompany's oil and gas exploration and development costs, EnergyMinister Marcel Masse announced.    The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year intothe oil and gas industry and could lead to more than onebillion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.    The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada onor after April 1, 1987.    Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aidpackage is aimed at small and medium sized companies.    The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration andDevelopment Incentive Program, will restrict the total paymentsthat any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.    Masse said the program will probably generate newemployment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.    He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration anddevelopment spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oilprices fell during the first half of 1986.    Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decidedto provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax payingcompanies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the fullvalue of the incentive. Such companies would not immediatelybenefit from tax benefits, he said.    The federal government also wanted to deliver an aidprogram outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilsonis now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce taxreform proposals later this spring.    An important feature of the aid program is a decision tolet companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors tobenefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits toonly participating companies, he said.    Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make iteasier for companies to attract investors in exploration anddevelopment, Masse said.    He told reporters his department is still consideringwhether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify forthe subsidy. Reuter&#3;"

2,"A unanimous Supreme Court ruled thatoil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off theAlaska coast which were leased by the federal government toeight major oil companies.    The ruling was an important victory for the oil companiesand the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasingprogram and a setback for two small Alaskan villages thatchallenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.    The administration said that the court-ordered halt indrilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paidfor 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.    A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to haltall exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts inthe Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to thesubsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.    But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong inissuing an injunction halting exploration.    ""Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration wasnot at all probable,"" Justice Byron White wrote for the court.""And on the other side of the balance of harms was the factthat the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrsto exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 whichthey would have lost without chance of recovery had explorationbeen enjoined,"" he said.

2,"A Soviet geologist said scientists needto coordinate data about onshore and offshore oil deposits tohelp identify global formations that would indicate otherpotential discoveries of oil and gas reserves.    Vladmir Vladiminovich Semenovich, the head of petroleumgeology at Moscow State University, told delegates at the WorldPetroleum Congress that exploration efficiency could also beimproved through new and more sophisticated technology.    ""We should emphasize that when having the data aboutpetroleum distribution onshore and offshore, it is possible toclarify the idea of global regularities in oil and gasprospects,"" Semenovich said. ""However, much work should be doneto coordinate data concerning the structure and oil and gasprospects in adjoining onshore and offshore basins.""    Sharing the information could help geologists betterpredict regional trends and underground formations thatindicate the presence of oil or gas, he said.    Semenovich also said that existing estimates of thepotential oil and natural gas resources of the world may needto be revised upward as oil companies continue to examineunexplored regions.    The world, which has already produced 476 billion barrelsof oil and gas, has a current total of about 733 billionbarrels in proved reserves. Undiscovered resources areestimated at about 1.4 trillion barrels, or about half of thetotal ultimate reserves, Semenovich said.    ""There are a lot of unstudied regions all over the worldand, as far as the already known basins, one continues to findadditional reserves,"" he said, noting that Antarctica has beenvirtually ignored. ""The existing estimate of potentialresources of the world may need to be enlarged.""    To find deeper and more expensive reserves, scientists willneed to use 3-D mapping of underground formations and laserspectrometry to measure bitumen in soils and plants among othertechniques, he said.    He estimated that continental slopes contain about 10 to 13pct of all offshore reserves.    Semenovich also said that virtually all of the total oiland gas resources now estimated to exist in the world would bediscovered and placed in production during the next 50 years.    After his speech, Semenovich told Reuters that Soviet oilproduction was increasing. ""The difficulties of 1985 have beenovercome and we're now back to normal production,"" he said.    The Soviet Union, the world's largest producer of oil, hadexperienced drilling and technical problems that cut totalliquids production from 12.45 mln barrels a day in 1984 to 12.1mln barrels a day in 1985. Last year, the Soviets produced anestimated 12.3 mln barrels.    When asked about the recent reopening and testing of a coalgasification project in Soviet Central Asia, Semenovich saidthe project was important because of the lack of oil reservesin the region.    Semenovich declined to identify at what level of world oilprices the coal gasification process would become economicagain. ""It's too expensive for the time being,"" Semenovichsaid.    ""Theoretical development is underway and tests are beingrun. For the moment, coal gasification is a very small part ofthe energy industry,"" he said. Reuter&#3;"

Tappmeyer told the Offshore Technology Conference thatcontract drilling was reaching the same kind of situation thatoil producing companies reached when their oilfields werenationalized in nations as Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia.     He said local connections to the nation whose waters arebeing drilled was an increasingly important factor in themarket.

Tappmeyer, who is president of the InternationalAssociation of Drilling Contractors, said how far the trendwould spread depends on the growth of trade protectionism.     He added that international contractors will increasinglyfind their role restricted to regions that require specialexpertise and experience, such as wildcat areas and severeenvironments such as in the Arctic and extremely deep waters.     Tappmeyer also said he expects producing companies toprovide the main financing for offshore drilling in the comingdecade as banks will be unwilling to repeat overexposingthemselves and drilling contractors will have difficultyproviding financing out of cash flow.     At the same time, he said he saw the financing as indirectas he does not see producers getting back in the rig-owningbusiness.     He also said projectfinancing will have to be backed upby work commitments to guarantee the payoff of constructioncosts.     For the time being, he said there was a superabundance ofrigs.

But he added that as the industry moves more and more tofloating systems as opposed to fixed bottom supportedstructures, the financial risks involved were greater.     He said such projects involved six to nine year timeframes, and there was a ""reluctance for people to stick theirnecks too far out.""     Shell holds the world record for the deepest exploratorywell, at 6,900 feet, in the Wilmington Canyon in the Atlanticoffshore New Jersey in 1984.     The company is currently drilling a 6,700 foot well in theAtwater Valley in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Louisiana.     Meanwhile, Brazil's Petrobras set a world record forunderwater production when they brought a well in 1,350 feet ofwater offshore Rio de Janeiro state into production in January.

Of particular interest is the controversial Penrod-72system being operated by the Dallas-based Hunt brothers wholast year placed Placid Oil under bankruptcy court protectionin order to avoid foreclosures on its valuable oil properties.     They have been seeking the right to use assets to drilloil wells in the Green Canyon through Penrod, arguing thatcontinued development of the project is essential to theirability to get out of their financial crisis.     Earlier this month, the Hunts were granted permission by abankruptcy court to pursue the Green Canyon project.     The Penrod system involves a controversial floatingproduction platform with well heads sitting 1,350 feet down onthe ocean floor. Some 24 wells will be attached to thewellhead, with one satellite well sitting in a record 1,700feet of water.

After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against thecosts, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee wouldhave a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year.    Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cutthe federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energyconservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil.    But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs wouldreduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domesticoil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found.    ""Any attempt to increase our energy security by limitingimports will actually reduce our long-run energy security byspeeding the depletion of domestic reserves,"" the study said.

Exxon's new president Lee R.Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a Frenchrefinery.    An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis thatdepended on the evolution of the market and refineries' abilityto make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos surMer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investmentover 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.    The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacityof seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, thespokesman added.

2,"A spokesman for the EuropeanCommunity Commission defended the controversial plan for a levyon oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to helpalleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.    Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission'sDirectorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oilsand Fats Contact Days ""the Commission firmly believes that thesacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers inthe oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers tomake an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problemwithin that sector by paying a levy.""    The proposed tax is necessary because the level ofbudgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseedsproduction has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.    Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion EuropeanCurrency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's ""standstill""agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would thenfeel the full impact of its enlargement.    The Commission has proposed several cost and productioncutting measures which include the introduction of a maximumguaranteed quantity system, he added.    Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumerprices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghesaid.    Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatoryamount when market prices are below or above this level.    He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatoryamount would be used to finance the Common AgriculturalPolicy's oils and fats regime.    ""The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to theproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incompleteor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,"" he said.    Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.    It would not be discriminatory because it would be appliedto domestic and imported products, and past experience showedit would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.    EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they dounder present aid arrangements, he said.    The competitiveness between different oils, whether ECproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantitiesimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,Tanghe said.    The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overalleffect would stabilise Community production levels withoutaffecting demand, he said.    It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain currentimport levels, he said.    Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they areimported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and mealsrequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from importedbeans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.

2,"Petro-Canada, Canada'sstate-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineationwells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshoreNewfoundland.    Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering workshould put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a developmentplan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.    Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production asearly as 1991, Petro-Canada said.    ""We have a high degree of confidence that the westernportion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mlncubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,and that we could produce it economicly using a floatingproduction system,"" Petro-Canada said.    The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, wasdiscovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.    ""We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion ofthe field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove upadditional reserves there,"" the company said.    Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercialprospect and the company wants to move some of those resourcestowards development so it can start generating a return oninvestments, Petro-Canada said.    Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells,has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block ofthe Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's EastFlank block, a company spokesman said later. Other fieldparticipants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, TrilliumExploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.

""At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to getthe job done,"" Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairswill depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult toassess because of flooding on the Red River.    The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crudeoil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 dayspreceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.

2,"U.S. crude oil prices are at theirhighest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPECmeeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect anypolicy changes from the session.    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since theorganization's accord in December, have risen on technicalfactors within the market and concerns about supplies becauseof the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from theGulf.    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is tradingaround 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York MercantileExchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is itshighest level since January 1986.    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria'soil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna tobe brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and productionagreement may only need a slight review.    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmationof the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due toa desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soonafter the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increasedtension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, pricesshould begin easing.    ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreedto in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, avice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mlnbarrels in the fourth quarter.    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, risingfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and areduction in output.    ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues totrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance thatOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said NaumanBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, suchas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.    ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in theofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, arecommitted to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua,analyst with L.F. Rothschild.    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meetingin September to re-evaluate market conditions.    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in thefourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels aday and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, presidentof Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at thismeeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs tooffset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominatedthroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,producers receive less money for their oil.    ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,""said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.    ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not toproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore actas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a twodlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" hesaid.    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.    ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the PersianGulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurites.    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have beenregular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administrationis planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of theU.S. flag, with naval escorts.    ""Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisislike this, and just general nervousness over an incident thatcould disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,"" Knuettel said. Reuter&#3;"

President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruledout a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to helpthe depressed domestic oil industry.

""They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (abarrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hastyretreat from that point of view,"" Margoshes said.    ""They are more appropriately today looking moreoptimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs(long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe thatwill be exceeded,"" Margoshes said.    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate wastrading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.    Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buyup the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share whenoil prices were falling last year.    They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightlymore than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oilfield. Analysts also said the company has other interests inthe Alaskan North Slope.    Analysts said the Standard investment is extremelyattractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market andhas hard-to-replace reserves.    ""I think it just fits in with their long-range plans toincrease their position in the U.S. market,"" Dean Witteranalyst Eugene Nowak said.    Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of theBritish government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BPstock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holdingsometime in the year beginning April one.    After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserveswould be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock isheld in the U.S.    ""The only way they can sell all that stock is to move itinto the United States. No other market can handle all thatstock,"" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.    In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs onrevenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the yearearlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.     Reuter&#3;"

""The perception of a turnaround comes from the change inprices,"" Charles Siess Jr, vice chairman of MarathonManufacturing Co, a subsidiary of USX Corp &lt;X>, and chairman ofthe National Ocean Industries Association, said in a pressbriefing at the Offshore Technology Conference.     ""From the level of industry activity, there is noturnaround,"" he added.     John Huff, president of Oceaneering International Inc&lt;OCER>, was slightly more optimistic. ""We are through the lowpart of the cycle -- there's an increase in interest forprojects,"" he said, adding, ""whether it comes to orders, whoknows?""     The oil industry is recovering from last year's dramaticfall in oil prices, from 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to under10 dlrs in mid-1986. Particularly hard hit were the servicecompanies that provide the oil rigs with keys products, such aspipe and tools.     Earlier in the week, Secretary the Interior Donald Hodelannounced -- at the Conference -- the government's newfive-year offshore oil and gas leasing program, proposing 38sales, including tracts in the Gulf Coast, offshore Californiaand in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.     For the most part, the industry was disappointed with theplan, with most arguing that additional areas should have beenincluded. At the same time, most were supportive of Hodel.     Environmental concerns, particularly in California, hadlobbied strenuously against offshore oil development.     ""The (Outer Continental Shelf) leasing program fails totake into account the environmental performance of the oilindustry,"" said Bill Bradford, executive vice president ofDresser Industries &lt;DI> and president of the PetroleumEquipment Suppliers Association.

""The OCS is the keystone of the domestic reservedevelopment program,"" said Siess, adding that with oil importsrising to 50 pct of U.S. oil consumption, the issue was one ofnational security.     Looking ahead, Constantine S. Nicandros, president ofDupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc subsidiary, said, ""We are more likelyto see a five pct increase in spending this year than thewidely-forecast five pct decrease.""     Other optimistic signs include the recent sale in NewOrleans of offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico which raised290 mln dlrs against an expected 90 mln.     However, Ronald Tappmeyer, vice chairman of Reading andBates Drilling Co &lt;RB>, said the oversupply of rigs wouldcontinue for the near-term, but added demand fortechnologically advanced rigs would increase in the 1990s.     Much of that demand is seen coming from the move intoicreasingly deeper waters, with the projects becoming ever moreexpensive and needing five to ten years to develop.     Over 50 pct of the sales in New Orleans were for deepwater tracts.     Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co, asubsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell &lt;RD>, and president of theMarine Technology Society, said the technology existed to drillexploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water.

2,"The United States' dependency onforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Associates.    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conferencehere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as muchas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous highlevel of 47 pct in 1977.    ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oilimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990.    ""However, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction,"" Lichtblau said.    He said that one of the government's negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration.    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.    ""An international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than ifwe imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said.    Development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessenU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.    A potential for alternative supplies could limit thewillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offertax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the StrategicPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plansfor alternative energy.

""Several companies say they are willing to start trading,""Yates told Reuters in an interview.    The company last week had stated that a number of domesticand international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oilshipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.    Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and other banks toldTexaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texacosaid in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P.Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for depositsto cover transactions, it said.    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arosefrom an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. SupremeCourt in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> overthe acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco'splea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.    ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as theycould,"" Elton said.

3,"Speculation abroad that theBundesbank will steer money market rates lower, opening thefor interest rate cuts around Europe, is not shared by manyeconomists and money market dealers within Germany.    Speculation has developed that the Bundesbank wouldengineer lower rates to take pressure off the dollar/mark.    A strong rise in U.S. Market rates this month, promptingspeculation the Fed would raise its 5-1/2 pct discount rate,has raised the question whether Germany and Japan would alsobroaden interest rate differentials to support the dollar.    The U.S.-Japanese trade dispute is the key to the interestrate outlook, money market dealers in Paris said.    Talks this week between Japanese Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone and President Reagan, if successful, could takepressure off the dollar, dealers and economists said.    Short term interest rates would be likely to ease if thetrade dispute is solved and the dollar steadies, they said.    But if no solution is found, the Paris dealers said, arenewed dollar fall would put strains on the mark/French francrate and force the Bank of France to raise short-term rates.    The three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate rose to six pctthis week from 5.6 pct at the start of April, and the yield onthe 30-year benchmark treasury bonds rose this week in Tokyo toa 14-month high of 8.86 pct from 7.66 pct in late March.    The dollar stabilized today just below 1.80 marks and above140 yen, underpinned by higher U.S. Rates and the Fed discountrate speculation.    But most dealers expect it to weaken further, which wouldput pressure on the Bundesbank to ease interest rates.    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said yesterdaythe U.S. Had requested Japan to cut short-term interest rates.    The Bank of Japan was making efforts to do this, he said,adding the U.S. Had not asked for a cut in Japan's 2.5 pctdiscount rate, a move which Bank of Japan Governor SatoshiSumita said was not under consideration.    A call for a German move came yesterday from Dutch centralbank president Wim Duisenberg, who said the Dutch central bankfavoured a cut in West German interest rates and would followsuit if it happened.    Citibank AG said in its April report that another expectedphase of dollar weakness would prompt the Bundesbank to cut keymoney market rates in the next three to six months.    The Bundesbank has set a fixed rate of 3.80 pct onrepurchase pacts since February, with call money trading around3.70 pct for much of April.    Phillips and Drew senior European economist Richard Reidsaid the Bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further,either with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interestrate, allowing the market to set the rate.    ""I'm fairly confident we'll see lower rates,"" he said.    Reid said taking 30 basis points off the repurchase ratewould have little impact on the German economy or fundamentalexchange rates, but could change market currency perceptions.    ""A cut in German rates wouldn't be bad for the dollar, but Ithink its effect would be limited in duration unless it wasaccompanied by other measures elsewhere,"" he said.    Money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad thatthe Bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said theBundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at themoment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month.    The dealers said the Bundesbank was likely to move to aninterest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month. Thatshould not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however,they said.    The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interestrate tenders, following the introduction of a new system tospeed up the tender process at the start of April, they said.    Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at theDIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said theBundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts.    ""I don't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a littleit would stop a wave of (currency) speculation,"" he said. But asharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force theBundesbank to take some action, he said.    Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut ininterest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth.    Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that themonetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows ratherthan credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate responseto excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to makethe mark and mark investments less attractive.    Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investorswould switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, whichhave swollen central bank money stock, into securities, whichwould take them out of the Bundesbank's key monetary measure.    A cut in interest rates at this stage however would leadinvestors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the nextmove would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buyingbonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen.    There are so far no signs that German investors areswitching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbankhopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bankeconomist Hermann Remsperger said.    But Phillips and Drew's Reid said prospects of lower ratesand a strong currency would attract foreign investors intoGerman bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors.    Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerlandin Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates wouldcontinue to drift lower in many European countries.    ""The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britainbut more limited in West Germany, where we could see someconsolidation,"" he said. Switzerland could be forced to matchany cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising furtheragainst the mark, he said.    Currency dealers in London said another half-point cut inU.K. Bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as thepound had shrugged off yesterday's cuts and was still rising. REUTER&#3;"

3,"U.S. Bond trading is likely to remaincautious in the near term with a possible downward price biasas market participants focus on trends in the dollar, theeconomy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said.    Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains,that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed willkeep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months.    Until trends are clearer, ""the market can only attempt to toestablish and hold a new trading range at higher interestrates,"" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthysaid that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthyinvestment climate, the market will have no confidence in thisenvironment until there is illumination of and confidence inU.S. Dollar/trade policy.    Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market,highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged ifcurrency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseaseconomic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.    ""The crucial question, however, is how soon either of thesedevelopments is likely to occur,"" Kaufman said.    ""Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio managerconfidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a whilelonger,"" said Philip Braverman, chief economist at IrvingSecurities Corp.    However, Braverman said that, ""from a longer termperspective, current (bond) prices provide a buyingopportunity.""    Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday onunexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasurybonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole andThursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high.    Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a longbond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism.Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday.    The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in asimilar ""paroxysm of pessimism,"" the key bonds reached a similarclosing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance,however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring theyield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.    Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc saidthat many portfolio managers now believe yields could approachnine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.    Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts havespoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher andthey continue to believe that an upward bias is likely topersist over the next few months.    Held said that in conversations with portfolio managerslast week there appeared to be increasing belief that the raterise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct bymidyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.    ""Yields could rise further over the next few months, but therise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seensince the start of the year,"" Held said.    Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.    ""The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,"" saideconomists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.    They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push upinterest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollarand head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harmthe fragile U.S. Economic expansion.    The Lanston economists said, ""The Fed cannot ease its policystance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calmdomestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat ofcausing a further decline in the dollar.""    Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policyunchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policylater if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or creditmarkets warranted a policy shift.    However, economists generally believe that continued fairlysluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S.Banks resulting from their problem loans to developingcountries rule out any Fed policy firming.    There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC atlast Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.    This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have littleimpact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due onWednesday, with March producer price data out Friday.    There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S.Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economicindicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. AFriday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's firstquarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNPgrowth of about three pct if continued through 1987.

3,"Currency futures are likely to movehigher following the sharp rally today after President Reaganannounced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term asFederal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominatedas his replacement, currency analysts said.    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices betweennow and the June 8 Venice economic summit.    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude tothe dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,analysts said.    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearinga bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks inChicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was atechnical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,analysts said.       ""Disappointment of European central bankers over theappointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollarlower,"" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president CarolMackoff.    ""The international community will not like thisappointment,"" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy andthat Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought toreduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst DavidHorner.     Furthermore, ""that Greenspan was not named two months agosuggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,""Horner said.    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futuresprior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigatedonly by concrete action as opposed to ""jawboning"" at the G-7summit, he said.    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, maybe at an impasse, analysts said.    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neitherplanned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from theU.S. to do so, Mackoff said.    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficitas Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut itsbudget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in thedollar could be forestalled, Horner said.

In remarks before the afternoon session of theInternational Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said hewas not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.    ""But I do suggest,"" he said, ""that we need something to giveit more stability and to keep it headed in the right directionwhen the wind shifts.""    He said that indicators can serve ""as a kind of compass"" butadded that structural indicators can help focus attention onsome policies.    Baker, however, said the IMF ""needs to move beyondmacroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators thatcan help focus attention on some of the policies of specificrelevance to the imbalances we face today.""    The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be givena more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- ArticleIV consultations -- that the Fund performs.    Baker also told the policy making group that it was timefor the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMFsurveillance more relevant to national policymakers and thepublic.    ""In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMFappraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use offollow-up reports on country actions to implement IMFrecommendations, and greater use of special consultationprocedures,"" he said.    Baker emphasized that indicators were a device ""for movingbeyond rhetoric to action.""    He said they provide ""more structure to the system, andinduce more discipline and peer pressure into the process ofpolicy coordination.""    He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to bereviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.    ""This should be matter of priority for the executive board,""he said.    Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternativemedium-term economic scenarios for countries that ""can help usfocus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, byidentifying options for addressing them and analyzing theimplications of these options.""    He said also that further work should be done on findingpaths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.

One major French bank said it bought between five and 15mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to thedollar.    Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of Franceto say it was in the market, a departure from the centralbank's usual insistence on confidentiality.

""Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you wouldstill be talking of a small overall amount,"" said one dealer.

3,"Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financialmarkets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar'swake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology thatis likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's declineas the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fellsharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.    But that confidence is now cracking as the financialmarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker'soften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.    ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollarfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" saidDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washingtonfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have acredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, shortof further depreciation of the dollar.    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amidworries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scareaway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spikein interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average downby 33 points to 2339.    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called themarkets' instability frightening. He believes economicfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""onceyou start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.""    ""There's a stark possibility that you could get adestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest ratesand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.""    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economicsin Washington, has been warning for a long time that thecontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.    ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... Butthe agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters.    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later thisyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that itwould take very little to touch off what he calls the secondphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in thedollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop onMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent withhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets arenot affected until a currency is in the final stages of itsdecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latestweakness was the loss of credibility that central bankssuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from fallingbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set aspart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss ofconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announcedplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronicimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.    Many economists believe that long-run stability will notreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap isaddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in themassive budget deficit.    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and ofcentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have nochoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.    ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is asubstantial increase in the discount rate and a correspondingcut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones.    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interestrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden forAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others.    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs andCo, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the FederalReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weakagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollarweakness,"" he said.    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress beingmade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.    ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in thebudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobodycares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69will have been greater.    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse andthinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly thata further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. ""Put onyour helmets,"" Giordano said. REUTER&#3;"

3,"The European Monetary System marks itseighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world moneymarkets despite creating an island of currency rate stabilityin Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,which holds eight European Community currencies within narrowfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), hasbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alikeseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu asEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming realitywhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.    But economists say members such as West Germany have so farblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system'sfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt andformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.    Under this phase, originally due to have started two yearsafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have beentransferred from national governments and central banks to anautonomous European Monetary Fund.    But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty ineconomic and monetary matters. ""The basic problem of the EMS isthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to asituation where certain decisions are taken in common,"" said oneeconomist who has closely watched the system's development.    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy onthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is thesystem's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged andinvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharprise of the West German mark severely strained the system.    Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend theEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major worldcurrency, outside the system.    No change in the British government's attitude is expectedbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since itwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC'shighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of CentralBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministershold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involvemore than tinkering with technical details. They are scepticalabout the chances for any fundamental change.    ""Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMSagainst external factors such as dollar weakness. For that wemust take the step forward to the institutional level,"" said Leode Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.

Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auctionsystem would be used to allocate foreign exchange to privatebidders but not to fix the exchange rate.

A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers,payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments ofmark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with theBundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System(EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banksbuilt up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.    The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billionmarks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time asan earlier securities repurchase pact matured.    Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as sixbillion marks.    The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman saidyesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to rollover, the possibility that other central banks may choose toredeem them meant a net infusion was needed.    Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.    Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over thefirst nine days of March.    Dealers said although the figure was well above an expectedrequirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow offunds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meetthe requirement toward the end of March.    No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week,but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity ifconditions significantly tighten. ""The Bundesbank wants to keeprates around 3.80 pct,"" one dealer said. REUTER&#3;"
3,"Japanese trade figures are seriouslychallenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Groupof Seven industrialised nations that relative currency ratesare the key to smoothing world trade problems.    Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo saythey are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currenciesare the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japanshrinking?    What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar downmade world trade problems worse rather than solving them,fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast ofworld trade recession?    U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollarfall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Fivepact in New York.    The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pctmore competitive in Japan. The officials, most of themeconomists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.    Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan risingrapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declinedonly 11 pct against the yen.?    Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widelyinterpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollarmust go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?    At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials canonly offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.    ""I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,"" said HughRichardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.    ""What I do know is that Community exporters are making ahell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, thereis money to be made in Japan,"" he added.    But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive tradepractices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such asagriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonablechecking and customs procedures for car imports.    Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in theface of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, theyblame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.    ""We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,""said a senior official, who declined to be named. ""We like torefrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.""    Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of theKeidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Moritarepeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort tounderstand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree.

3,"In a bid to hasten Japan's promiseto speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreigntrade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaledtheir tolerance of a lower dollar.    Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides,Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was notarget for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaringagainst the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention.    ""That was no slip of the tongue,"" said one western monetaryofficial, who asked not to be identified.    For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japaneseofficials said late last week a package to bolster domesticdemand will be ready in early April. Until last week, therewere few indications the package would be ready anytime soon.    The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congressover the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billiondlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results fromJapan, dramatic action is required.    Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs oncertain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhereto a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries.    The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appeasemounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes justtwo weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to reviewthe Paris agreement to stabilize currencies.    And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr tradesurplus in the first two months this year just underscored theneed for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials.    Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in thedeficit. ""I'd be stunned if we were not going to derive somebenefits (from the lower dollar) soon,"" said one.    In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperateclosely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting""underlying economic fundamentals"" or economic reality.    The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japanand West Germany stimulating their economies and the UnitedStates cutting its budget deficit.    The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada,agree these policies are essential to redress huge global tradeimbalances.    But analysts say markets have signalled the underlyingfundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one.    Markets, in effect, are less confident than governmentsthat these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cutsagreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out.    Nonetheless, the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was ontrack and Tokyo and Bonn seem ""to want more stimulative measureswhich is what the Paris accord calls for.""    International monetary sources said exchange marketdevelopments generally have not unsettled policymakers,although Japan is an obvious exception. ""Everybody feels it canstill be managed,"" one source said of market developments.    But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated fivebillion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and othercentral banks about one billion dlrs.    Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America'shalf-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting theParis accord outright.    The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economicpolicymaking, said Japan's understanding of the accord was thatthe yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level itstood at when the accord was struck.    The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington'suse of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a""pointed reminder"" to Japan to do something about the tradeissues, the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen.    By departing last Sunday from the language of the Parisaccord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stabilityaround current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar.    Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target forthe dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up totheir international responsibilities and stimulate growth.    But U.S. officials said recent market developments will notunravel the spirit of the Paris agreement.    ""There's a realisation now that you cannot leave thingsalone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalancesought to be adjusted,"" one official said.    ""While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, wecertainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,""another U.S. official said.    The officials said the meeting here, where the six will bejoined by Italy, will be a status report.    ""Japan will have to explain what the state of their programis and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there's a needto move faster,"" one source said.    Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, ineffect, for currency stability for several months. This wouldbuy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economicgrowth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit.    His comments appeared to serve notice on other majornations that Washington cannot wait too long for action toreduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surplusesand the U.S. trade deficit.

Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against themark to levels around 1.60, the European Monetary System wouldundergo a ""test by fire.""    Delors said the current problems in the markets had beencaused by excessive growth in financial trading, excessivederegulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the worldeconomy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changingcircumstances.

3,"German banking authorities areweighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in anattempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticatedcapital market instruments, banking sources said.    Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options areunder closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they mayresemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. ToJapan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division ofbanking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-Britishproposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate.    But banking sources said West Germany was more likely toproduce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals.    ""There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latterstages,"" one representative of the German Banking Association inCologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year.    All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, WestGermany's four major banking associations and the FederalBanking Supervisory Office.    Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changeswould require a revision of Germany's credit law, which hasbeen in effect since 1934.    Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fitpresent circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentarypolitical process of changing it, banking sources said.    Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limitedbanks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves,on a consolidated basis.    But lending ratios do not extend to several newerinstruments such as spot and forward currency contracts,currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs,currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currenciesand various innovative types of interest rate hedges.    The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposalslay in differentiating between different types of risk factor,and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swapsthan interest swaps. But even if German banking authoritiesagree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree onhow to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.    U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series offormulae for assessing the stream of payments involved inswaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financialintermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.This is the so-called market-to-market value.    But German authorities are likely to consider this much toocomplex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule oflending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness ofthe borrowers involved, the sources said.    The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extendedto include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for publicauthorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreignbanks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.    A further complication is that the more flexibledefinitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May putGerman banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.    Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version ofthe U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.And British authorities, the sources said.    One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-datedforeign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, bebrought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despitethe fact that the risk may be entirely different.    How new regulations will affect foreign banks here wasuncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status andapplied for a full banking licence over the last two years inorder to lead-manage mark eurobonds.    But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lendingratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement,particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if theyare required to include more transactions in the balance sheet,the sources added.

Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later thisyear, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche LandesbankGirozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by theU.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.    ""A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stockexchanges,"" Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned forfurther rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.    Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, manyinvestors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stockexchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.    Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG'sforeign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold ispoised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second halfof this year.

3,"European Community finance ministersand central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discussstrengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuingworries about turbulence on foreign exchanges.    Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host theinformal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bankchiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in thelight of the February agreement among leading industrialisedcountries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels.    In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accordbetween the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britainand Canada had proved itself ""more or less workable.""    But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have beengrowing since fears of a trade war between the United Statesand Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to arecord low against the surging yen early this week.    The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being heldto coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and ThirdWorld debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the InternationalMonetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week.    The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the maindiscussions will take place tomorrow.    Continued international currency turbulence could undermineplans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the jointfloat holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuationbands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda.    Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period ofcalm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stabledollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to makeit more resilient against exchange rate swings.    The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year asthe falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMScurrency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertaketwo major realignments of parities within nine months.    In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for awide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMSon the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by theEC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central BankGovernors.    The committees were asked to come up with the proposalsafter the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January.    Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, thefledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take overthe mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has metwith a cool response in West Germany.    He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would reportto the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalisecapital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, suchas the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls.    Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements withoutstrengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation inthe Community.     He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether memberstates were willing to push further towards the EC's goal ofmonetary integration on the basis of an EMS that includedmanagement of exchange rates by some kind of commoninstitution, instead of by national central banks as atpresent.    Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen bythe EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by thereluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove uptheir sovereignty in the monetary field.    EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusalso far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism. REUTER&#3;"

3,"Today's U.K. Economic data have pushedthe chances of another base lending rate cut from the currentnine pct further into the distance, analysts said.    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturingproduction data showed that the economy is still strong anddoes not need a fillip from lower rates.    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,taken together with higher than expected bank lending and moneysupply growth, revived inflation worries and monetaristarguments against easier credit, they said.    ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed backall the while. The strength of the economy and broad moneygrowth are making it more difficult to see one in the nearterm,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday'smortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societiessaid were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.Rates.    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week thata post-general election cut was imminent, supported by suchoptimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise whichmirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling'sstrength.    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasmabout May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidlyreplaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlyingaverage earnings in April, dealers said.    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lendingrose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bankof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offsetthe impact on domestic money supply of its currentintervention.    ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin,chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.    ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a verygood state indeed,"" Skeoch said.    ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationarypressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost riseswere better than expected, just one pct higher in the year toApril, and it was these costs rather than average earningswhich were potentially inflationary, he added.    ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a majorproblem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worriedabout the funding implications of recent intervention.    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assetsearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes thatthe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, nowlooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities tryto prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort GrievesonSecurities, said any fresh sterling strength would stilltrigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signalhigher inflation this year.

And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at theweekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lowerrange for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank ofJapan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.    ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, andanyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret itlater on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk thedollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, henoted.    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved inmonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Wouldnever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollaragainst the mark or the yen.    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and141.35 yen.    ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higherinterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but thisdoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic frameworkof the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said.    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid anyfurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not onlyhurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debtproblem.    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise theirinterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond marketsfurther, the monetary officials said.    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declinedto be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a furtherdecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationaryexpectations in the U.S.    ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvreagreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry officialsaid.    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday thatWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of WestGermany's increase in short-term interest rates.    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollardecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in theaccord, foreign exchange dealers said.    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additionalstatement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" andthis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, thedealers said.    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day inTokyo currency markets.    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguisedpressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rateshigher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,or international economic policy coordination.    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other'seconomic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" topersuade others to change their policies to a desired course,they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateralsurveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West Germanpolicy so openly,"" the ministry official said.

The official said Chung is expected to outline Seoul'sefforts to increase imports of U.S. Goods and to stress theneed for South Korea to maintain a trade surplus in the nextfew years in order to cut foreign debts totalling some 44.5billion dlrs.    South Korea has ruled out a major revaluation of the won,but is allowing its currency to appreciate slowly.

3,"Remarks by central bankers raised somehopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchasepacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of amove in the near term, money market dealers said.    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterdaythat rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth fromspeculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state centralbank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lowerlimit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but thedrop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotmentthis week dashed some hopes of lower rates.    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday innew liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by thepact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates onrepurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour morediscreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather thanthe more public adjustment of leading rates.    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate andallow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the casesince it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it mayallow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.This should then flow back into the market as it is depositedwith banks.    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.

Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain aproposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countriesthat do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their governmentdebt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firmsabroad.    He added, ""even Japan, against whom this proposal seems tobe particularly directed,"" has started opening its markets.    In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker alsosaid a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countriesby setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed tocommercial banks, was a problem.    ""I believe that the prospect of debt relief would underminethe difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries toachieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of thepolicies that are followed on servicing external debt,"" Volckersaid.    It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant toextend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said.    Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury SecretaryJames Baker ""about the inappropriateness of using publicresources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which weboth see as an inherent aspect of the proposed internationaldebt facility.""

3,"Parliament approved a proposal to dropall controls on capital outflows, raising the prospect thatTaiwan's vast resevoir of foreign exchange will flow into theworld economy.    A government spokesman said the new law would bepromulgated by President Chiang Ching-Kuo within 10 days andfinancial authorities would then be empowered to lift controlson currency outflows at any time.    Tight restrictions on capital inflows introduced this yearwill remain in place, the spokesman said.    Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-Cheng has said the controlswill be lifted at the end of next month or early in August.    The central bank and finance ministry proposed liftingcurrency restrictions to help reduce Taiwan's foreign exchangereserves, which stand at about 60 billion U.S. Dlrs and haveled to runaway growth in money supply.    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan andWest Germany, also draw attention to Taiwan's huge tradesurplus and the government fears they are making the island atarget for U.S. Trade protectionism.    The surplus rose 34 pct to a record 7.32 billion U.S. Dlrsin the first five months of this year and about 90 pct of itwas with the United States.    Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.9 pct in theyear to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.    Local bankers and economists say when the controls arelifted, businessmen will be allowed to buy foreign currency andinvest it freely overseas. But they warn against expectationsof a sudden outflow of capital.    ""I don't think we're going to see a big bang,"" John Brinsden,the Taiwan manager of Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters in arecent interview.    Bankers said that businessmen have been holding vastquantities of foreign exchange overseas for many years and alsohave been freely buying and exporting currency through aflourishing black-market.    ""Obviously there will be an outflow of funds ... But I don'tthink it's going to be much,"" said Danny Chan, director ofFidelity Securities Investment Consulting Corp.    Economists say the success of plans to encourage capitaloutflow depend on whether the central bank can slow the rise ofthe local currency.    The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 23 pct against theU.S. Dollar since September 1983, prompting an inflow ofspeculative money. It rose by one Taiwan cent today to close at31.08.    The government spokesman said the new law does not empowerauthorities to permanently lift capital controls, but anyproposal to reimpose them would need the approval ofparliament.

""As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --then we'll get a strong movement upward,"" Wyttenbach said. Butthat may not come soon.    ""People are simply worried that in America, where the markethas now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,""he said. ""People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988.""    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the currentproblems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. ""We do not have amark problem, we have a dollar problem,"" he added, but said thebiggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. FederalReserve Board, Alan Greenspan.    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that thedollar might be too high in the medium term and that interestrates might have to rise. ""As a central banker he shouldn't dothat,"" Wyttenbach said. ""There is a danger that we will fall backinto the 1970s,"" he said. ""We have a real crisis of confidence inGreenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker.""    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: ""I'm relatively optimisticbecause the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has tointervene.""    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to takeany significant steps, adding that the focus of attentionremains on the United States.

3,"Interest in the currency futures markethas shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentiallyexplosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continentaland Japanese currencies, analysts said.    The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the pastweek-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to thedollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom.    ""Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...andtechnically, the pound is in the best shape,"" PaineWebberanalyst Jason Gillard said.    ""We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, andwe're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,""Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said.    Many traders took on long pound/short West German markfutures positions, although some of those cross-trades wereliquidated yesterday, Sloane said.     The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have beenrelatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimismsurrounding the British economy, analysts said.    ""Money seems to be chasing yields,"" William Byers, of BearStearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate.    Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in thepound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek torelieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing downinterest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17.    The budget itself could have an impact, depending on howwell it is received, but analysts say relative interest ratesand oil income remain the main influences on the currency.    However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K.interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cuttheir discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloanesaid.    The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, butSloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon.    The sideways price pattern in the June contract, withsmaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a ""bull flag"" onprice charts, technically-oriented analysts said.    ""It makes for an explosive type of situation that oftenleads to a breakout,"" in this case to the upside, Sloane said.    Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadiandollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recentclose at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar.    ""At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-termpositive, but for the technical burden of proof you need aclose above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,"" Byers said.    As to the traditionally more active currencies, stabilitywas the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts.    Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs andJune German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400,respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430.    Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still veryrespectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bankintervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada.    ""We may still probe to see what the parameters are,"" Byerssaid, ""but people are very reluctant because they don't knowwhere the central banks will be (to intervene).""    Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous priceconsolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundlysluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer atthat level. Reuter&#3;"

3,"U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker met WestGerman Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and BundesbankPresident Karl Otto Poehl in Frankfurt on Monday, a BonnFinance Ministry spokesman said.    After the meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg assaying he was confident that foreign currencies could bestabilised at around current levels.    The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany forincreasing short-term money market interest rates. He had saidthe rise was not in line with the spirit of the Louvre accordaimed at stabilizing the U.S. dollar last February.    The meeting had been arranged last week, the spokesmansaid. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue thepolicies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference tocurrency stability and monetary policy.    Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak injected liquidity intothe West German money market in a move which money marketdealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German monetaryauthority to curb interest rate rises.

3,"Central banks have easily beaten backthe foreign exchange market's first test of the industrializednations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said.    In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar,sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. Butoperators got their fingers burned as one by one the centralbanks signalled their displeasure.    ""So far G-6 has been a roaring success,""said James O'Neill,financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA.    ""The central banks are sending strong signals that theywon't tolerate any kind of momentum building behindcurrencies,"" added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank.    On February 22, the finance ministers and central bankgovernors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K.-- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord underwhich they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability ofexchange rates around prevailing levels.    The agreement was viewed by many in the market as anattempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeabletwo-year decline against major world currencies.    And initially, traders indicated their respect for theaccord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower.    But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday beforethe G-6 accord.    The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economypicked up steam in February at the same time as the West Germaneconomy was regressing.    But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gavetraders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed theidea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines.    Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bankactually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simplytelephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about tradingconditions.    But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around1.85 marks. ""The market was surprised that the Fed showed itsface so soon,"" said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill.    Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of Englandintervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K.currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before theG-6 pact.    Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies likethe Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor aftertraders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuantto the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit playson dollar/mark and dollar/yen.    The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improvingU.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for theincumbent Conservative party in any general election.    ""There was a real run on sterling,"" said Anne Mills ofShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterdayand from a peak of about 2.98 recently. ""There's been someheavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday'sU.K. budget,"" said James McGroarty of Discount Corp.    As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. andBritish central banks, they acclerated their shift intoCanadian and Australian dollars. But here too they werestymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise.    The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollartoday, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday.    And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent,sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said.    The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. centstoday from a high of 69.02 Thursday.    Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle suddenupward movement, leave the market uncertain about its nextstep. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to avery tight range against the dollar for several months.    The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night.Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound longsterling/short mark positions established lately.    ""Because of the change in perceptions about the health ofthe German economy, the funds from those unwinding operationsare ending up in yen,"" a dealer at one U.K. bank said.    Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders,lower industrial output and slowing employment gains.    Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities whohave invested heavily overseas, for example in Australianfinancial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of theend of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.    Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the mostcontroversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit withJapan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test ofthe dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency.    In its latest review of the foreign exchange market throughthe end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that itintervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28.On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen.    ""Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level inJanuary. But the market has to bear in mind that time marcheson and the situation changes,"" said McGroarty of Discount. Reuter&#3;"

3,"The United States appears to have won atransatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interestrates, European economists said.    But they added Washington set the stakes high by testingthe limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets wereplunging.    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment tocurrency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,according to official statements released late Monday.    Only 13 hours after the statements were released, theBundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banksliquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pctfacility rate offered last week.    While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbankpresident Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also addedmoney market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want astrong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.     ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew inLondon.    But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken oneof the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the WestGermans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05percentage point.""    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tighteningof West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall andfuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February'sLouvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetarypolicies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency marketsand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours tradingin New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar wasquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at DeutscheGenossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on worldstock markets had been the main reason for the fall in WestGerman short-term interest rates on Tuesday.    ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock marketlosses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fitswith Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said.    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and theBundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following risesin the U.S., Aschoff said.    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the centralbank has no interest in higher capital market rates and hethought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First BostonLtd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreatand Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as thesecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it wasbefore the IMF meeting last month in Washington.""    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord wasreaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidityat 3.60 pct, Keating noted.    Economists said the United States now appeared to haveagreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and supportthe dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinderWashington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenbergtold a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not ruleout central banks of leading industrial countries interveningon exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed WestGermany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currencystability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German centralbanks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force themto again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar. REUTER&#3;"

3,"Talks are underway between financiallytroubled Zaire and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aimedat rescuing the economy of the second largest nation insub-Saharan Africa.    Diplomatic and banking sources in Kinshasa agreed that acompromise formula could be reached in the coming weeksenabling pro-Western Zaire to obtain a much needed injection ofcash.    For its part the government is expected to increasebudgetary discipline, which in turn is likely to attractforeign investors, the sources said.    ""Barring last-ditch obstacles, which can't be totally ruledout in an issue involving a nation's pride and substantialpolitical and economic interests, Zaire and its creditors arebound to come to terms soon,"" a Western diplomat told Reuters.    ""The Zairean economy won't survive without massive IMFassistance. Similarily, the West has no interest to see Zaire'sstrategic minerals fall into communist hands,"" the diplomatsaid.    Zaire defied its creditors late last year by saying itwould limit repayments on its five billion dlr external debt to10 pct of its export earnings from January 1987.    The government also announced an end to the floatingexchange rate for the zaire currency and a return to a fixedparity against special drawing rights (SDRs) with periodicadjustments.    Until last year, Zaire devoted up to 28 pct of its exportrevenue to servicing large foreign debts contracted during thecopper boom of the 1970's to finance largely non-productive andoften extravagant investment projects.    Zaire, the world's leading cobalt producer and the sixthlargest supplier of copper, depends on the two minerals fortwo-thirds of its export earnings.    ""A young country cannot go on indefinitely sacrificingeverything for the sake of servicing its external debt,""President Mobutu Sese Seko commented in October when heannounced his government's decision.    As early as January 1986, Mobutu had warned that ""one doesnot feed on austerity and praise. I have another debt, onetoward my people and my people's efforts must not backfire,"" hetold diplomats.    Zaire pointed out that during four years of IMF-backedausterity (1983-86), it had become a net exporter of capitalwithout receiving appropriate financing from abroad.    Economists said that since the large devaluation of thezaire currency in September 1983, the country suffered a netoutflow of 830 mln dlrs each year.    Zaire's medium and long term public debt in the past fewyears reached an equivalent of about 100 pct of its GrossNational Product (GNP), one of the highest such ratios in theworld, banking sources said.    Mobutu accused the IMF of ""strangling"" his country at anOctober meeting of the ruling MPR party and said his peoplecould not long endure the hardship caused by austerity.    Zairean officials blame their present difficulties on theIMF recovery plan's two basic assumptions which, they said,failed to materialise last year,    - a world economic recovery pushing up commodity prices andboosting Zaire's export revenue and debt servicing capacity,    - substantial, additional financial help from the country'straditional donors.    In 1983 Zaire set out on a major economic reform aimed atcurbing its soaring debt. It floated its currency, slashedspending and privatised industry, gaining praise from Westerncreditors and obtaining debt rescheduling.    As a result, the overall economic and financial situationimproved markedly, with inflation down to 41 pct last year from100 pct in 1983.    But it also led to a severe and steady fall in livingstandards for Zaire's 35 mln population, fuelling widespreaddiscontent among poorer city dwellers, diplomats said.    Economists estimate the drop in purchasing power at between20 and 35 pct for an average household over the last 12 months,despite a pay rise of up to 67 pct for civil servants announcedlast May.    The World Bank has released in the last two months half ofa previously-agreed 80 mln dlrs industrial sector loan and lent27.6 mln dlrs to modernise the country's vital river transportsystem.    Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler and its main tradingpartner, recently agreed to release a total of 17 mln dlrs toease payments difficulties and finance imports of spare partsfor industry.    A new agreement between the IMF and Zaire would pave theway for another debt rescheduling, probably at the next meetingof the Paris Club of Western creditor nations, diplomats said. REUTER&#3;"

Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing ofthe U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months.

3,"Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany'scentral bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg arenormally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt thecentral bank's independence.    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over acontroversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes ofthe country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt lastThursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs andinterest rates    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl'scriticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive placefor foreign investors.    ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank andFinance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreigninvestors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who askednot to be identified.    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financialpolicy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship tosteer the economy through a particularly difficult time.    ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will resultin things getting back to normal again after a period of illfeeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pctwithholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds ina market already reeling from rising interest rates at home andabroad.    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way thefinance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting theBundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflictingdetails to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been underextraordinary pressures lately.    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by hisdeputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fightinflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he hadpursued so far this year to promote currency stability.    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more likeSchlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has beenwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supplygrowth would eventually lead to rising prices.    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbankcouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent hisviews, bankers said.    ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank'sPfister.    ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is notentirely his own,"" said another economist.    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the markand hurting West German exporters.    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since theBundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary JamesBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany tostimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a roundof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult forStoltenberg than he had bargained for.    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly votedmost popular government politician last year, had to faceresistance from local barons in the government coalitionparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising4.3 billion marks.    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it willpush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs thegovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political rowwhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal.    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington lastmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state ofSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign afterallegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavylosses for the CDU in state elections.    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva lastweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the moreremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, andwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier thisyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition governmentgave Poehl another eight-year term.    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said hehoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he wasnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating theBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said. REUTER&#3;"

3,"The Bundesbank did not intervene asthe dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243yesterday, dealers said.    Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over theEuropean morning, with operators made wary by today's meetingof the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefsahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington.    It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of EconomicAdvisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S.Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar.    Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchangerates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting onFebruary 22, a ""vague statement,"" casting doubt on operators'assumptions that a secret target level had been set.    Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progressto stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged,""there would not be the necessity of significant declines in thedollar.""    One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tendedeasier after the remarks. ""They were obviously regarded as beingnegative. And if the market starts regarding anything thatcomes out negatively then it means that the underlyingsentiment is negative,"" he said.    Some early selling pressure softened the dollar'sundertone.    Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japanto support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen byinstitutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said.    After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recentweeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31,interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said.    ""We can start to look at a point in time where the interestshifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and theother European currencies,"" the U.S. Bank dealer said.    Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary oftaking significant new positions during the Washingtonmeetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today,Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the GermanAffairs group on international monetary issues later.    The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank seta new securities repurchase tender to add money marketliquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over thelast several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that itmight cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender,signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy.    Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller saidthe Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. Amonetary policy which took into account exchange rates andcapital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rateoriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment.

3,"The dollar is expected to decline furtherin coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness oflast month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates,senior foreign exchange dealers said.    Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealerssaid they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down.Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month'saccord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing thedollar down, the dealers said.    ""The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerthat the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for majorcurrencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,"" said KojiKidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasurydivision.    He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention ofintervening to support the currency.    ""This eliminated the widespread market caution againstpossible joint central bank intervention,"" Kidokoro said.    Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downwardmomentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardlycontain a further slide in the currency.    They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers,and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollarsthrough the U.S. Central bank in New York.    Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reservewould intervene on its own account to support the dollar, butsome said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148yen.

He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next monthwhen corporations reduce their dollar sales after they closetheir books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.    But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollarremained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance ofthe U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit andJapanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.    ""The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia instimulating its economy,"" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistantgeneral manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's internationaltreasury division.    In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package ofeconomic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, toboost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce itstrade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate onthe budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott ofparliamentary business over the proposed introduction of asales tax.    In the circumstances the government had only a slim chanceof producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.

Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. interventionwas not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied thatthe administration judged that after economic adjustments,current exchange rates reflect underlying economicfundamentals.    In particular, the stability sought by the nations wouldallow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economiesdomestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulfordsaid in his testimony.    He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar wouldhurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth.    Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy wasaffected by international developments.

4,"Swiss lawyers have largely headed off anattempt to restrict banking secrecy and curb their powers toact for clients despite the new, revised code of bankingconduct agreed by the Bankers' Association this week, analystssaid.    The ""laundering"" of drug and ""insider dealing"" money andcontroversy over accounts of the ousted Philippine and HaitianPresidents have hurt the standing of Swiss banks recently andstrained international relations, particularly with the UnitedStates.    Critics said the new code fell well short of demands forreform, doing little to close a key loophole in the requirementthat banks know the identity of their customers.    The Social Democratic party, a member of the rulingfour-party coalition, which forced an unsuccesful 1984referendum to curb banking secrecy, complained the code stillfell short of the legal controls they wanted.    ""It looks a slight improvement on paper, but the same trickswill still be possible in practice,"" Felix Meier, a senior partyofficial, told Reuters.    In contrast, Swiss lawyers are happy with the new code.    ""Apart from a few nuances, we are very pleased with theagreement,"" said Max Oesch, a senior official of the SwissLawyers Federation, which has fought a long campaign to preventany curbs on lawyers' ability to act for their clients.    ""It has shown that the 4,000 Swiss lawyers who do a good jobshould not be punished for the sake of getting at the one ortwo black sheep.""    The role of lawyers has been at the centre of long runningdiscussions on the renewal of the so-called ""convention ofdiligence,"" a voluntary code of banking conduct introduced inresponse to a major banking scandal here in 1977.    With secrecy back in the public eye due to the FerdinandMarcos case and a Swiss bank link to the recently busted ""PizzaConnection"" international heroin ring, officials at the BankingCommission said earlier this year they wanted a tightening ofrules on anonymity.    However, the changes in the new code, which comes intooperation in October, have been minor.    Clients will still be able to keep their identity secretfrom the banks provided their lawyer pledges that therelationship with his client ""is not only of a temporary nature""and involves provision of other legal services.    The Lawyers' Association said this part of their businessis very minimal anyway. In the majority of cases, people hadperfectly legal private or commercial reasons for not wantingthe bank to know their identity, Oesch said.    The Banking Commission, despite its earlier demand for avirtual abolition of the loophole, also said it was happy withthe new code.    However, critics complain that the agreement does not gofar enough to restrict the role of lawyers and could still becircumvented by criminals.    ""No other group in society is allowed to regulate itself asmuch as the banks,"" complained Meier of the Social Democrats. ""Ihope that the Banking Commission exercises its proper controlfunction.""    However, other parts of the agreement won praise.    In particular, banks will also now be required to demandthe identity anyone doing more than 100,000 Swiss francs worthof business with them, even if they do not have an account atthe bank. Until now, the threshold was 500,000 francs.    Peter Kluser, head of the National Bank's legal department,which had argued for a lower limit, said the move could helpcombat the use of banks to ""launder"" or hide the criminal originof money.    The new code also clarifies the legal status of a tribunalable to impose heavy fines on banks which do not respect thecode. REUTER&#3;"

Theschedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuinggrain the CCC accepts or purchases during the year.    The department said it is possible that producers could beencouraged to delivery higher quality grain to CCC by adjustingthe premiums and discounts.    Comments are due by April 24 and a report to Congress isrequired by law by May 10. Reuter&#3;
4,"American Express Co's plan to sell astake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be aprelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,analysts said.    American Express earlier said it has a generalunderstanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.    The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,as investors speculated on the possibility of more investmentin the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.    The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response tothe relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents aprice of 2.7 times book value.    Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insidertrading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8times book value.    American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. Forthe last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors ofa spinoff of part of Shearson.    Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit willbenefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasinglyimportant Tokyo financial markets.    ""I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step,"" saidLong.    ""What you will see probably in the future is AmericanExpress selling an additional 17 pct in the public market andhave a public vehicle for Shearson,"" Long said.    ""Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitmentinto an illiquid situation,"" he said of Nippon.    Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake inShearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, likeother investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.    American express has said the total employees of shearsonwill expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, thatnumber is substantially lower than growth last year, a companyspokesman said.    American Express officials would not comment beyond astatement made this morning. That statement, however, did notclose off the possibility of a public offering or other optionfor Shearson.    David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possibleShearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believesthe firm will digest the Nippon investment first.    ""I think they'll figure out what they're going to do withthe money they have,"" he said.    Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also saidAmerican Express could determine to sell shares to the public.    In its statement, the financial services giant said it iscontinuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition tothe investment by Nippon.    American Express said options under study range fromexpanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competitionto broadening its access to capital.    American Express also said the options reflect thecontinuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'worldwide financial services strategy.    Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding aJapanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake toSumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.    Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.    ""Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. Theydon't have the money. There's just not enough internal capitalgrowth,"" said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows otherU.S. brokerage companies.    Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, areinterested in the expertise of American brokers. ""Those(Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies havethe capital needs and the growth opportunities to use themoney. That's a nice marriage,"" he said.

4,"West Germany's banking authoritiesare being drawn into the currency scandal surroundingVolkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> as the repercussions and allegations inthe financial community widen, banking sources said.    The Bundesbank has seconded one of its currency experts tohelp the state prosecutor investigating the currency fraud atVolkswagen, VW, in Brunswick, a Bundesbank spokesman said.    The Federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin alsois considering press allegations that several banks ""parked"" openpositions with VW, breaching banking regulations.    Earlier this month Volkswagen said it had incurredpotential losses of 480 mln marks in an alleged fraud involvingthe hedging of open currency positions.    The foreign exchange activities of a large non-bankcorporation would not normally attract the attention of WestGerman banking regulators.    Their strict foreign exchange rules, set up after theHerstatt banking crash in 1974, apply only to banks.    ""This strict banking supervision aims to protect specialinterests -- creditors and depositors,"" the Bundesbank spokesmansaid, adding company shareholders were not covered.    ""The Volkswagen case, in so far as it involves Volkswagen'snormal foreign exchange business, lies far outside the area ofthe Bundesbank,"" he said.    The Bundesbank's decision to send a currency expert toBrunswick to help investigations into activities involvingVolkswagen's foreign exchange dealing room was part of thenormal assistance rendered by one public authority to another.    The expert will count as part of the state prosecutor'sstaff and not report back to the Bundesbank, he said.    But the Bundesbank could get more closely involved inallegations that banks used VW to circumvent regulations.    Section 1a of the Banking Law requires banks at the closeof business each day to hold no more than 30 pct of theircapital and reserves in open positions.    The section was introduced after the Herstatt bank crash in1974 due to currency speculation.    The Platow Brief financial newsletter said on Friday thatabout 16 banks, mainly foreign, had been circumventing section1a by ""parking"" such excess open positions with VW.    This would mean that the bank concerned would sell theposition temporarily to VW, buying it back a day or so later.    However, such repurchase agreements are expressly includedin section 1a as still counting as open positions.    A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office inWest Berlin said it was following the allegations butinvestigations were difficult because the 16 banks had not beennamed. He declined to say what steps were being taken.    But banking sources said the Supervisory Office as aninitial step had approached the Platow Brief for the identityof the banks, but this had been refused. The Platow Briefdeclined comment.    If the Supervisory Office ascertains that the bankingregulations have been infringed, it will pursue the case withthe assistance of the Bundesbank.    The Office, subordinate to the Finance Ministry, does nothave branches outside Berlin.    The independent Bundesbank however operates 203 branches inWest Germany, closely monitoring local banks.    Banks deposit statistics, including currency position data,once a month with the Bundesbank's regional administrations atfederal state level, the Landeszentralbanken (LZBs).    Currency dealers said parking excess positions withnon-banking corporates was frequent practice.    Such positions would often be sold for tomorrow/nextdelivery, with a verbal agreement to buy it back the next dayat the same rate.    A VW spokesman said it was company policy not to undertakecurrency hedging but he confirmed that arbitrage was allowed.    He declined to estimate the volume of currency arbitraging.German press reports have put it at 80 billion marks a year.    The spokesman declined to comment on how it would have beenpossible to carry out a fraud involving currency hedging giventhe company's policy not to conduct this kind of business.    VW finance director Rolf Selowsky accepted responsibilityand resigned. VW has suspended six other officials and firedits former foreign exchange chief, Burkhard ""Bobby"" Junger.

The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs pertonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latestreport on Export Markets for U.S grains.    EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes inthe 1985/86 season, it said.

However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mlnwas not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.    The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecastin mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare forsoft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 andthe record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.    This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry ofAgriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectaresagainst 4.61 mln in 1986/87.

4,"Current interest by Soviet charterers intaking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. Tocarry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recentsurge in values on the Baltic International Freight FuturesExchange (BIFFEX), dealers said.    Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today forthe first time in the spot position since the market opened inMay 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with valuessome 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which iscalculated on spot physical rates.    No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings butthey have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which wouldnormally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said.    ""It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effecton its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported,"" one said.    Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route havesubsequently been the main beneficiary of current charteringconditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left forthe remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risensteadily for vessels loading next month.    Dealers said there is even talk that owners are consideringtaking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand.    Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chineseoperators may be in the market for similar timecharter businesslater in the year, they said.    They anticipate this would appear around June and it hasprompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite itnormally being a slack time in the shipping year.    Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Ratesturned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which hadsupported the market at the start of the year, faltered butthen recovered on the reported Soviet interest. Reuter&#3;"

4,"Current prospects for this year'sgrain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable thanin 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Belgradesaid in a field report.    The report said the assessment was based on travel in thetwo countries from March 30 to April 4.    It said crop conditions were better than earlier expectedfollowing the extreme dry conditions last fall and theprolonged winter temperatures this spring.    However, in general plant development was at least threeweeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions variedgreatly by regions, the report said.    Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, andespecially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in goodcondition, with little evidence of winterkill, while othersvaried considerably, the report said.    Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak anduneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in thosefields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said. Reuter&#3;"
4,"Rain over wide areas has raised theprospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffereda disastrous drought and famine two years ago.    Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's AgricultureDevelopment Department, told reporters prospects were good forattaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the presentgrowing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.    Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnesa year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the ""belg""(small) rains which fall at this time of year.    The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops likemaize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affectsproduction in the main rainy season, because farmers eat theirstocks of seed.    Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regionswhich suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sowtheir crops because of the favourable rains.    The government had distributed large quantities of seed andfertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop. Reuter&#3;"
4,"Asked what the U.S. StateDepartment's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow,Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leadersthat U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.    ""If we are going to sell our products, whatever they maybe, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,""Shultz told the board of directors for the National Associationof Wheat Growers.    ""We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say thatsomebody is going to buy your product if they can get the samething at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't,"" hesaid.    ""That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets,and it must be our approach as we look at the American farmprogram and try to figure out what we should do to make itbetter,"" Shultz told the Wheat Growers.    Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation thatwould allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than theAmerican housewife, he realizes the importance of Americanagricultural products being competitively priced.    Speculation has been in the market for some time that theUnited States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Unionat subsidized prices.    Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if itwere competitively priced. Agriculture Department officialshave declined to take any official position on the issue. Reuter&#3;"
4,"U.S. corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassedacreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as oneof the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixtyyears, Agriculture Department officials said.    USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures willlikely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.    Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. cornproduction will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987corn production could drop by over one billion bushels toaround seven billion bushels.    Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grainsprogram, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservationprogram, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrainanalysts said.    ""There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease incorn acreage,"" one said. ""It's difficult for any farmer to notgo along with the program this year.""    Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year butat a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.    Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, theysaid, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.    If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then thedrop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 whenfarmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.    Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. Asevere drought that summer in major producing states causedyields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2billion bushels.    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analystssaid the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billionbushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.    ""This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significantreduction in production,"" an analyst said.    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would notincrease significantly, a specialist said.    High producing corn belt states are expected to show thegreatest acreage reductions, based upon historicalparticipation in government programs, analysts said.    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the mostin marginal producing areas of the southeast and the westerncorn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.    ""Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,""he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts inhigher-producing delta areas.    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, hassteadily declined in the 1980's.    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been inthe low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. Thehighest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA haskept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mlnacres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yieldsaveraging 119.3 bushels per acre.    ""We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billionbushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,"" an analyst said.    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres aslong as government program provisions remain the same, analystssaid.    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required toset aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligiblefor payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15pct of their acreage.    ""To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have toprovide more incentives,"" an analyst said. Reuter&#3;"

4,"The Zambian government has no immediateplans to follow last week's increase in the producer price ofmaize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, anofficial of the ruling party said.    Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price forrefined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots inwhich at least 15 people died.    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda laterrevoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail priceincrease, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,a practice discouraged by the IMF.    ""There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels ofmeal. It (the government) would have to choose between thedemands of the IMF and those of the people,"" a Ministry ofAgriculture economist said. Reuter&#3;"

4,"Recent announcements from Moscow ofnext year's grain production targets indicate that the Sovietsare estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,Agriculture Department analysts said.    USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, butsome earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.    Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst ofSoviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article inIzvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be""25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.""    ""This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213mln tonne (grain) crop,"" the analyst said.       In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figurepublished in a Soviet economic journal this month.    USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects arange of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.    Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvestprogress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.    While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agricultureofficial Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would beas good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.

4,"French Agricultural MinisterFrancois Guillaume warned that France would flatly rejectproposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugarand oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt thesemarkets.    The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the interventionperiod and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase thefinancial burden on the sugar producers will also result inlower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.    ""I give you my word that France, while it will not rejecttechnical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply replyin the negative to these bad reforms,"" Guillaume told the annualconference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).    Community agricultural ministers are due to meet againMonday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spirallingEC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.    Relations between the government and farmers have becomestrained in France in recent months.    There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations byfarmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices andfurther cutbacks in Community milk output.    But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisationof the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a majorproducer of both crops -- won him warm applause from theFNSEA's farmers.    His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for thecomplete dismantling of the system of cross border taxesdesigned to smooth out currency differences known as MonetaryCompensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoidfurther protests by producers.    Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to goahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroadagainst the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farmsector.    ""The Minister's proposals back up our determination toorganise union action in the coming weeks,"" he told reporters,adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on aministerial level.    Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before beingappointed farm minister last spring.    Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt thatGuillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.    There have been certain advances on cutting productioncosts, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, butthere are still areas where more could be done such as onfarmers' indebtedness, he said.    Guillaume told the conference the government will makeavailable 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producersreduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.    The government has already announced financial aid for themilk sector and it was not clear how much of the packageannounced today was new aid, Lacombe said. Reuter&#3;"

He told the National Press Club of Japan that because Japanhad a large export balance, not just with the U.S. But withother countries, it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pctself-sufficient in one product.    Speaking after farm trade talks with Japan agricultureminister Mutsuki Kato, Lyng said the U.S. Had not asked fortotal liberalisation of the rice market in Japan.    Lyng urged Japan to allow some imports of rice.    ""We want to have some access in the rice market,"" he said.

Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak.""    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money.    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity.    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of ""over-production and price interventionin the developed nations.""

In that case,Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of theCanadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. cornexports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.

4,"U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the ConservationReserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutralto bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdownwould be needed to assess the full price impact.    ""Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted incorn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what thetrade was looking for,"" Dale Gustafson of Drexel BurnhamLambert said.    The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres intothe conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837acres.    Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate ofplanted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, butsome other analysts said they would adjust their estimatesslightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentionsfigures March 31.    Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation programrecently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreageto 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.    Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities,said there was not enough information to completely assess theconservation figures. ""The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainlydisappointing,"" he added.    The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of theenrollment figures.    Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative forboth new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean anupward adjustment in planting intention figures.    Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificatesonto the market this spring, he said: ""The trade was definitelylooking higher, so certificates are going to be less thanexpected.""    The USDA offered a special corn ""bonus"" rental payment tothe farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonusamounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm programpayment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into thereserve.    Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, saidthe conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she hadexpected, although she noted that some trade expectations wereconsiderably higher than the actual figures.    ""I think it is friendly for the market, at least in thelong run,"" she said.    Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was someconfusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figurebetween 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up orthe latest addition.    ""It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bidinto the program,"" she said.    Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideasabout corn planting figures as a result of the conservationsign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in thehigh 60's.    Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slightreduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate toaround 64 mln acres.

4,"Swiss lawyers have largely headed off anattempt to restrict banking secrecy and curb their powers toact for clients despite the new, revised code of bankingconduct agreed by the Bankers' Association this week, analystssaid.    The ""laundering"" of drug and ""insider dealing"" money andcontroversy over accounts of the ousted Philippine and HaitianPresidents have hurt the standing of Swiss banks recently andstrained international relations, particularly with the UnitedStates.    Critics said the new code fell well short of demands forreform, doing little to close a key loophole in the requirementthat banks know the identity of their customers.    The Social Democratic party, a member of the rulingfour-party coalition, which forced an unsuccesful 1984referendum to curb banking secrecy, complained the code stillfell short of the legal controls they wanted.    ""It looks a slight improvement on paper, but the same trickswill still be possible in practice,"" Felix Meier, a senior partyofficial, told Reuters.    In contrast, Swiss lawyers are happy with the new code.    ""Apart from a few nuances, we are very pleased with theagreement,"" said Max Oesch, a senior official of the SwissLawyers Federation, which has fought a long campaign to preventany curbs on lawyers' ability to act for their clients.    ""It has shown that the 4,000 Swiss lawyers who do a good jobshould not be punished for the sake of getting at the one ortwo black sheep.""    The role of lawyers has been at the centre of long runningdiscussions on the renewal of the so-called ""convention ofdiligence,"" a voluntary code of banking conduct introduced inresponse to a major banking scandal here in 1977.    With secrecy back in the public eye due to the FerdinandMarcos case and a Swiss bank link to the recently busted ""PizzaConnection"" international heroin ring, officials at the BankingCommission said earlier this year they wanted a tightening ofrules on anonymity.    However, the changes in the new code, which comes intooperation in October, have been minor.    Clients will still be able to keep their identity secretfrom the banks provided their lawyer pledges that therelationship with his client ""is not only of a temporary nature""and involves provision of other legal services.    The Lawyers' Association said this part of their businessis very minimal anyway. In the majority of cases, people hadperfectly legal private or commercial reasons for not wantingthe bank to know their identity, Oesch said.    The Banking Commission, despite its earlier demand for avirtual abolition of the loophole, also said it was happy withthe new code.    However, critics complain that the agreement does not gofar enough to restrict the role of lawyers and could still becircumvented by criminals.    ""No other group in society is allowed to regulate itself asmuch as the banks,"" complained Meier of the Social Democrats. ""Ihope that the Banking Commission exercises its proper controlfunction.""    However, other parts of the agreement won praise.    In particular, banks will also now be required to demandthe identity anyone doing more than 100,000 Swiss francs worthof business with them, even if they do not have an account atthe bank. Until now, the threshold was 500,000 francs.    Peter Kluser, head of the National Bank's legal department,which had argued for a lower limit, said the move could helpcombat the use of banks to ""launder"" or hide the criminal originof money.    The new code also clarifies the legal status of a tribunalable to impose heavy fines on banks which do not respect thecode. REUTER&#3;"

4,"Enrollment in the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's fourth conservation signup is expected to beannounced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may behigher than total enrollment for the first three signups.    Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres,USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far inthe 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.    Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres intothe program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA'sAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at acongressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will beaccepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.    As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area isexpected to attract the greatest enrollment.    ""The Great Plains area will be the predominate area whichwe'll get signup in,"" a USDA conservation specialist said.    Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of theacreage pulled from that area, he said.    Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreagein the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production,but the USDA source said this would be a relatively smallpercent of the total.    A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll partof their corn base acreage into the program has sparked moreinterest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.    Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to takeland out of production for 10 years. The average rent paymentaccepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre. Reuter&#3;"

4,"A Portuguese court has made apreliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPACshould not be allowed to take part in public import tendersopen to private importers, grain traders and officials said.    Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to theEuropean Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC(Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reducedby 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.    Private traders protested last year that EPAC was beingpermitted to take part in tenders open to them for the firstliberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs.The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legalproceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders.    Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civilcourt, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not beallowed to take part in tenders open to private traders.    Trade sources said the ruling, though effectiveimmediately, was subject to appeal and would have to beconfirmed in further proceedings.    A member of the government Cereals Market Commission saidthat, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission wouldnot be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender beingheld today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn.    Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC'sparticipation in the public tenders violated the clauses ofPortugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradualdismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.    It also said the participation of EPAC, which stillcontrols the national grain storage and distribution network,was unfair competition to the private traders.    Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commissionwas unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring toleave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue.    ""They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile,"" onetrader said.    ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels ifnecessary. Reuter&#3;"

4,"Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countriesfor emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by thecountry's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.    Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aidneeded for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.    The letter said the government had to step in ""to avertserious economic hardship"" and because the Social ServicesMinistry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provisionof 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.    The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a sixmonth period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice cropwas harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour andother cereals were required, it said, along with supplies ofsugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.    In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha(October 1986-April 1987) crop had been ""almost completelydevastated,"" the letter said. Maha paddy output was nowestimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originallyexpected.    There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a highforecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequaterainfall within the next three to four weeks.    ""Should the present drought continue, however, production isestimated at around 20 mln bushels,"" the letter added.    Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Lastyear's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.    The letter said villagers in most seriously affecteddistricts had been deprived of any means of subsistence becausesubsidiary crops had also failed.    It said the government's current budget did not permit itto provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected.""Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodityprices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continueto exert pressure on the expenditure side.""    The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees permonth for each family, as well as handling, transport anddistribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds bythe government would not be possible without seriouslyimpairing development projects, or ""greatly fuelling inflation""in the economy, the letter said.    The letter said the Food Department would be able torelease wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet theimmediate cereal requirements ""provided such stocks are replacedsubsequently.""    The Meteorological Department said the country wasexperiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-monthdry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break whenthe monsoon rains fell in late May.

4,"Implementation of a one-year 0/92pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promotedtoday by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommitteeas a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmersanother option when making their planting decisions.    ""We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,but we are locked into this,"" said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. ""We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt thefarmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both.""    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 billfor 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickmansaid that it will probably be introduced next week.    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer toforego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiencypayment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided underthe current bill.    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meetbudget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better thansharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply adifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from governmentpayments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at thispoint, he said.    ""I don't think there is any interest in pursuing adecoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,"" Glickman saidat the hearing.    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of theBoren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. Hisplan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment toparticipating farmers, require that idled acreage be put toconservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extraidled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acresin a county and provide tenant protection provisions.    ""I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, butwe can at least move in that direction,"" Boschwitz said.    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testifiedin favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current biasin U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'dependency on the government, he said.    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnsonsaid, and would still encourage farmers to plant.    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association andthe National Cattlemen's Association said their groups opposeany 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening thefarm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.    But when asked if his association were forced to choosebetween a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, LarryJohnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

4,"The U.S. grain planting intentions andstocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, agrain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.    The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocksare ""the first report we've had for a long time that shows anyoptimism for anybody,"" said John ""Bud"" Frazier, grain analystand executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.    ""I'm really excited about it,"" Frazier said.    The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend toplant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted lastyear, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.    The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels ofsoybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushelsof wheat, all below trade guesses.    Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analystwith AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Tradepanel to discuss the reports.    Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendlyfor the market, and soybean prices would jump three to fivecents a bushel ""if the bell rang right now.""    ""We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn andsoybeans) than we thought we had,"" he said, noting that hog andpoultry production is up.    ""We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,""said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and15 pct in the preceding quarter.    However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceedconsumption.    She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres camein southeastern states, where yields are usually low.    ""We have the potential for record breaking soybean yieldsthis year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow'sopening,"" she said.    Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and thecrop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down fromlast year's 8.25 billion bushels.    ""We'll need very good disappearance next year to reducestocks,"" she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last yearat 6.7 billion bushels.    Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the longterm, ""But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks downto where we could start rebuilding prices.""    Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage reportcould prompt farmers to change their plans and plant moresoybeans.    The panelists agreed that the reports should discouragetalk of revising the 1985 farm bill.    ""There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm lawwe're working under today, and this report should reinforcethat,"" Frazier said.

He said commodity operations deputy administrator RalphKlopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour andwill meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week.    Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at thatmeeting, including the current concern over the gulf cornpremiums.

The USDA official also said that only those counties thatuse the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by thehigh barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices.    When asked if the USDA emergency storage program whichallows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge spaceand accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discountedthe idea.

4,"The use of generic commoditycertificates, or ""certs,"" for fiscal years 1986-88 will savethe government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of AgricultureUndersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.    Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on theuse of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 couldresult in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.    However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in netsavings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said.    Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly theentire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have beenforfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC.    In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have beenredeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges wouldhave remained in the goverment inventory, he said.    When asked to comment on a recent study by the GeneralAccounting Office that concluded certificates result in a netcost to the government, Amstutz said, ""GAO underestimated thebenefits and overstated the costs"" of the certificate program.    Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loanentries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions ratherthan forfeitures.    GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said.    ""There is no question in the mind of the Department ofAgriculture that these certificates have been very useful,""Amstutz said.    Immediate benefits of certificates include greater marketliquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farmincome, and improved debt situation and decreased carryingcosts, he said.    Certificates are an integral part of USDA's long-rangemarket-oriented farm policy, he said.    Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep.
